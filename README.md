# SMU_Mapping_Texts
Materials to accompany workshop on mapping locations found in texts.

Title: Visualizing Text Locations Using Python

Description: Have a collection of digitized books, music lyrics, letters, or articles, and want to visualize a map of all locations mentioned in the texts? Using the Google Colaboratory Python environment (https://colab.research.google.com/), we will walk through Python code to (1) automatically extract named locations from texts, (2) obtain coordinates for these locations by geocoding against the Bing Maps API, and finally (3) visualize these locations by overlaying on an interactive map. A variety of samples will be provided, but you are welcome to bring your own documents in text (.txt) format as well.

Note: No Python experience is expected or required.

Requirements:
1.	Any Google account (Most everyone will have a Google account.)
2.	Bing Maps Key  (While we will take time to register during the workshop, instructions are available here is anyone wants to be prepared: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key.)
