#Memphis announced the Liberty Bowl is sold out for the Top 25 matchup with #SMU on Saturday night. https://t.co/MtTIdwBKOg https://t.co/NAvtxUzE2N
Kinda a weak schedule for College Football tomorrow. I’m pumped about #SMU at #Memphis airing on prime time. AAC getting some rare love. Should be lots of points scored tomorrow night in #Memphis. Great seeing the #Mustangs undefeated in November.
Are these two helping or hurting #Trump with their nonsense. #field claims to be working with the #SMU #pentagonpedotaskforce..... ok. https://t.co/sgQmM7qeyJ
"The Night Before: #SMU at #Memphis. Primetime lights. @CollegeGameDay on hand.

"RIP to my professor at #SMU, Mike Stone.

Terrific lessons learned from him in sports, but most importantly, spend time gaining experience, not sitting in a 90-minute class getting lectured.

Always cut us loose on those Thursday afternoons. He’s in a better place now."

Russo was really sharp prior to the 1 series per half for Toddy . Carey made that move in the 2nd half of the #SMU game last week as well after his best series of the day. If he’s got it going don’t mess with it. Owls get a huge pitch and catch 21-14 Russo 2 Mack 75 yds #UCFvsTEM

"#SMU coach Sonny Dykes said WR Reggie Roberson missed the second half with a foot injury, but he isn't quite sure the extent of it. Will know more on Monday.

WR James Proche, who was horse-collar tackled, is OK, Dykes said. ""It looked bad,"" Dykes said but noted Proche is""fine."""

I like the shot on 2nd down by #SMU. Just not right then. You're still up with over 2 minutes to go. Get some yards on 2nd and get a manageable 3rd. Now you're off schedule and giving the ball back to a team with two TOs left. #SMUvsHOU #CFB

Even if #SMU wins, they will drop off my list next week, giving up so many points.
@ChrisVannini Why does #SMU do all the wrong things in this game.
Houston calls a timeout. There's 2:40 left to play. #SMU needs 1 more first down, maybe 2, to close the deal.
Clayton Tune’s 352 passing yards are the most given up by #SMU all season.
"On 3rd & 7, #SMU converts.

#UH still has all three timeouts left."
@WorldHogs @NikkiChavanelle @SMU_Football @RazorbackFB @coachchadmorris Your joking. Morris left #SMU with nothing. He even took recruits with him.

That’s how you run a play from your own 4. This #SMU team is so overrated, I am glad they are getting exposed tonight. Gifted two touchdowns and they are only up 3.

"Houston's Marquez Stevenson with a 96-yard TD catch. Wow.

"Clayton Tune’s pass to Marquez Stevenson for 96 yards cuts #SMU’s lead to five.

Now the longest play of the season for the Cougars. Puts Stevenson over 200 receiving yards on the night.

#UH goes for two and converts.

34-31 #SMU leads."
Stevenson is really really fast #SMU
#SMU's Trevor Denbow with a nice punt that pens Houston to the 4-yard line. Denbow has been very good today -- maybe better as a punter than a safety. Maybe.
"#SMU went for it on fourth down and got called for offensive pass interference.

Rain causes fans to head for the exits. Only the #UH and #SMU bands  are still seated in numbers. https://t.co/PiSxvL9GFa

#SMU is really good.
On 2nd & 9, Clayton Tune fumbles on a sack. 1st &amp; Goal #SMU from their two-yard line.
"Fumble! Pat Nelson with the strip sack, and Richard McBryde recovers the ball.

#ClubTakeaway on deck!

Ball at the 2-yard line for #SMU."
Will be interesting to see if #SMU will get Rashee Rice more involved in the second half.  The freshman has stepped up every time Rhett Lashlee has called his number. Dykes said after the Tulsa win he was impressed most with how Rice looked as though "he belonged."

Watching the #ESPNCFBThursday night #CollegeFootball game between #SMU and #Houston. I hadn't yet seen #SMU play this season--now I can see why they're undefeated!

"Another FG for Houston.
