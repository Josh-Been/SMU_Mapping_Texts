PRAYER
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Capitol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
We bow before You, O Sovereign Magistrate, in the solemn gaze of Moses,
Your emissary and lawgiver of truth
revealed, considering with all gravity
the eternal consequences our actions
create whenever we judge our fellow
man, knowing we shall all stand before
the judgment seat of Christ and give an
account to Him of every pejorative
word spoken.
For with what measure we judge,
from such measure we shall receive our
deserved judgment.
So may we first carefully examine
our own eye, asking Your Holy Spirit
to reveal and remove any beams that
have blemished our veracity.
May You be judge, O God, and plead
our cause against the ungodly, for we
have all sinned.

Deliver us from deceitful and unjust
men, for there is nothing hidden that
shall not be revealed. Mendacities spoken in darkness shall be shouted from
the housetops.
For Your mercy and grace we plead,
Lord Jesus.
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS
RECOGNIZING MS. STEPHANIE
WALKER

HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Ms. Stephanie Walker for her
impactful work and leadership in school bus
operation.
Ms. Walker started out as a bus driver, carrying on the legacy of both of her parents,
who have been driving buses for Habersham
County for over 30 years. Years later, Ms.
Walker is continuing to impact school transportation through her role as transportation coordinator for Habersham County Schools.
Earlier this year, Ms. Walker became the
first and only woman in Georgia, and the
eighth Georgian overall, to become a Certified
Director of Pupil Transportation. She is also
the only person in the state of Georgia to become certified as Director of Pupil Transportation and in Special Needs Transportation.
Ms. Walker’s focus on enhancing safety protocols has changed Habersham County
Schools for the better. During her seven years
as transportation coordinator, Ms. Walker has
reworked and created emergency routes to
ensure the safety of students and staff alike.
With 115-plus buses and their passengers to
account for every day, her job is not easy, but
she enjoys the challenge.
Ms. Walker’s notable work ethic and dedication has earned her a place in the national
spotlight. Earlier this month, she was recognized by School Transportation News, a national publication, as one of ten ‘‘Rising Stars’’
for her work as an up-and-coming student
transportation professional who displays leadership or innovation in school bus operation.
The students of Habersham County Schools
are fortunate to have someone like Ms. Stephanie Walker working to keep them safe every
day. On behalf of the people of Northeast
Georgia, I want to thank her for her commitment to student safety and congratulate her
for being recognized as a ‘Rising Star’ in
school transportation.

HONORING THE PASSING OF
ARIZONA TEACHER, CATHY CANEZ

HON. TOM O’HALLERAN
OF ARIZONA

dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with REMARKS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay my respects to Cathy Canez, a
special education teacher from my district,
who passed away earlier this year in a tragic
accident.
Cathy was a beloved teacher, friend, and
community member in the Miami unified
school district for more than 25 years.
Her kindness, sense of humor, and dedication to the success of her students has al-

lowed her legacy and impact to reach beyond
the classroom.
I’ve been married to a teacher for fifty years;
I saw how hard my wife Pat worked to educate young people and improve their lives holistically.
Teachers have one of the most important
jobs in our society, and a great teacher like
Cathy had the power to affect the lives of so
many.
Cathy was taken from us too soon.
Arizona has lost an incredible role model
and educator, but I know she will not soon be
forgotten.

RECOGNITION OF MRS. YVETTE
DUBOSE AS A 2019 ANGELS IN
ADOPTION HONOREE

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is my
great privilege to rise today to honor Mrs.
Yvette DuBose, for her extraordinary contributions as the CEO/Executive Director of the
Heart Gallery of Broward County and as a caring foster parent herself.
Yvette was recognized as a 2019 Angels in
Adoption by the Congressional Coalition on
Adoption Institute (CCAI). She is admired in
our community for her steadfast commitment
to the welfare of children as both a caring foster parent and as the Executive Director of the
Heart Gallery of Broward County, as well as
serving as a Board Member of the Heart Gallery of Florida and the Children Families Leadership Association. Her leadership at the Heart
Gallery has led to more than 350 adoptions of
foster children to their forever families, changing the course of their lives. Yvette’s longstanding dedication truly exemplifies the values of the Angels in Adoption program.
Founded in 2001, CCAI is a nonprofit organization with the vision that every child should
know the love and support of a caring family.
Every year, CCAI selects a small group of outstanding individuals, families, or organizations
across the nation to be recognized as Angels
in Adoption. These honorees have gone
above and beyond to demonstrate their commitment to improving the lives of children in
need of permanent, loving homes.
Madam Speaker, I am so very proud of Mrs.
Yvette DuBose for all the work that she has
done in our community. I wish her the best as
she continues her work to make the dream of
a forever family a realty for so many children
in need.

Barnstable as he steps down from the role of
Chief Executive Officer of the Cape Cod Military Support Foundation. A former executive
of Sheraton Hotels, Don has not slowed down
in his retirement but has been fueled by his
passion for serving veterans and active military personnel and their families. This commitment led him to establish the Cape Cod Military Support Foundation in 2014.
In his work, Don has recognized that children of deployed military personnel often feel
their absence most dearly during the holidays
and at other milestone moments. Therefore,
he started Operation Backpack, to supply military children with back-to-school supplies, a
holiday gift-giving program, and other holidaythemed events. In addition, the Foundation offers emergency and food assistance to military
families, as well as nursery supplies for babies
and toddlers. The families of Joint Base Cape
Cod benefit from these programs through the
Family Empowerment Center located on the
base, Don’s labor of love that opened in 2018.
His work through the foundation was especially vital to Coast Guard families during the
recent government shutdown.
In 20l7, Don was recognized as a Difference
Maker of the Year by the New England Patriots. He has been honored by the United
States Coast Guard, the Massachusetts National Guard, and the American Red Cross for
his work on behalf of military families. As he
steps down from his role as Executive Director
of the Cape Cod Military Support Foundation,
the legacy of his work will continue as it extends to serve military families across Massachusetts and indeed the nation.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Donald A. Cox for his dedication to serving our
military and veterans’ families. I ask that my
colleagues join me in thanking him for all of
his incredible work and wishing him all the
best as he continues to support our service
members and their families.

In 2002, Mr. Long was awarded the Air

Friday, November 1, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in honoring one of our nation’s foremost
liberation theologians, the Reverend Willie F.
Wilson, Pastor of the Union Temple Baptist, in
our nation’s capital. Reverend Wilson has devoted his life and ministry to uplifting, enhancing and empowering the lives of the downtrodden and to fighting for the dignity, justice
and liberation of all people.
Over the years, thousands have responded
to the power of Reverend Wilson’s preaching
and exhortation to ‘‘unchain your mind’’
through examining and reclaiming Jesus
Christ, the truth of African-American history
and learning to love ourselves as well as others. As a result, Union Temple’s membership
has grown from the initial 25 faithful members
to more than 8,000.
Reverend Wilson has served the Union
Temple Baptist Church and the District of Columbia community faithfully for 46 years. His
impact on the church is immeasurable. As he
passes the torch of leadership to his daughter,
Reverend Dr. Anika Wilson Brown, we wel-

PO 00000

Frm 00002

Fmt 0626

November 1, 2019

come her and thank Reverend Wilson for his
steadfast work.
Reverend Wilson, born in Newport News,
Virginia, received a bachelor’s degree in journalism from Ohio University. He became a
D.C. resident in 1969 and received a master’s
degree from Howard University School of Divinity.
Under his leadership, the Union Temple
Baptist Church achieved an array of firsts, including the first substance abuse ministry
based in a D.C. church; the first African-American church-led Rites of Passage program to
support adolescents in transitioning from childhood to adulthood; the introduction of
Kwanzaa Celebration as part of faith ministry;
the first ordination of women into Baptist ministry regionally; and the promotion of interfaith
worship between Christians and Orthodox
Muslims. The church invested millions of dollars in the development of affordable housing,
home ownership and financial literacy programs, as well as in youth development and
health promotion activities.
Social service programs have flourished at
the Union Temple Baptist Church, including
the Akoma project, which provides case management to individuals living with HIV/AIDS;
the AYA Program, a D.C. Department of
Human Services-funded program providing
counseling, job development and placement
services to assist people moving from welfare
to work; and the Village Keepers Homeless
Outreach Ministry, which provides shelter for
homeless individuals in D.C.—to name only a
few.
The Union Temple Baptist Church has
erected a home in Ghana, West Africa for its
Rites of Passage programs. The church has
donated over one million dollars in medical
supplies to the hospital in Asankrangwa and
sponsors an adopt-a-child educational program. Ordained a Wolof Priest in Gambia,
Reverend Wilson’s ministry and practice are
African-centric, focusing on the African influence on Christianity. His most recent book,
Birth of the Bible, is a commentary on ‘‘African
spiritual traditions borrowed, stolen, misappropriated and modified to produce the book that
we know today as the Bible.’’
Reverend Wilson’s work has not gone unnoticed. In 2018, Reverend Wilson was inducted
into the Hall of Fame of the Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama. He was recognized
in 1986 by USA Today ‘‘as one of the 10 most
valuable people in America.’’ In 1995, he was
asked to join the historic Million Man March as
a national organizer, and, in 1997, he received
the Presidential Service Award from President
Bill Clinton.
Reverend Wilson is the father of four children and is married to Reverend Mary Lewis
Wilson. He has served on the board of trustees of the University of the District of Columbia. Reverend Wilson has dedicated his life to
a creative, innovative ministry to uplift humanity. He has a deep abiding love for all people
and is a passionate voice for truth, justice and
equality for the citizens of D.C. and everywhere.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring Reverend
Willie F. Wilson for his dedication to freedom
and justice for all, and to the well-being and
faith of District of Columbia residents. We recognize him for the profound impact his vision
and his work has had on others.

OF GEORGIA

OF COLORADO

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and legacy of Thomas Hanie
Paris, Jr.
Tom Paris, Jr. was born and raised in
Gainesville, Georgia. While attending Gainesville High School, Tom was elected class
president and captain of the football team
where he earned All-State and All-American
honors. After graduating from high school,
Tom went on to play college football at the
University of Georgia where he earned his
bachelor’s degree in business administration
and was inducted into both Phi Kappa Phi and
Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Societies, all while
being a three-year letterman.
After graduating from college, Tom joined
the family business of Paris-Dunlap Wholesale
Hardware Company, serving as the company’s
president. Building on his success at ParisDunlap, Tom founded Paris Management and
Investment Company and Paris Storage Company.
Tom was often recognized for his success
in business, but above all else, he will be remembered for his devotion to his community.
Tom worked to advance numerous organizations throughout Hall County, serving as director of the Gainesville-Hall Chamber of Commerce, president of the Gainesville Rotary
Club, a founding trustee of Lakeview Academy, a trustee of both Brenau University and
the Northeast Georgia Health System board,
and a faithful member of Gainesville First
United Methodist Church, among many other
roles.
Even after his passing, Tom Paris, Jr. continued to move our community forward by raising funds in his memory to renovate the Humane Society of Northeast Georgia, which he
served as a board member for over nine
years. We were reminded of his legacy earlier
this week as the Humane Society held its ribbon cutting ceremony for the Paris Family Surgery Suite. The remodeled surgery suite honors Tom’s wish that the Humane Society of
Northeast Georgia renovate the surgery suite
to provide the most up-to-date care and technology for the animals of Northeast Georgia.
Because of Tom and the funds for this renovation, the Humane Society’s lifesaving spay and
neuter work will continue for decades to come.
Tom will always be remembered as a
steady leader in our community, but first and
foremost, he was a devoted son, brother, husband, father and grandfather. On behalf of the
people of Northeast Georgia, I hope you will
join Tom’s beloved family in celebrating his remarkable life.

Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr.
Wilfred George Perkins, a cherished family
man, business owner, and faith leader. Mr.
Perkins, a lifelong Colorado resident and pillar
of the Pikes Peak region passed away on October 19, 2019, at the age of ninety-one.
Will was born in Montrose, Colorado. After
graduating from Colorado College in 1949, he
married the love of his life, Bessie Lea Hastings, in 1950. Their remarkable sixty-nine
years of marriage produced children, Pamela
(Ted) Walker, Tom (Cheryl) Perkins, Karen
(Jeff) Sheets, and Sandra (Bentley) Tate,
along with fourteen grandchildren and eighteen great-grandchildren.
Mr. Perkins was a second-generation automobile enthusiast and salesman. Will owned
and operated Perkins Motors from 1958 to
1985. He also served two terms as the president of the Chrysler National Dealer Council.
Will was highly regarded in the business
world. He was a role model for his peers and
community leaders around the state and the
nation. Even competitors admired Will’s humble attitude and spiritual consistency. Upon retiring, Mr. Perkins passed the family business
on to his son, Tom, and later his grandson,
David.
Will’s public testimony to the power of the
Gospel was bold, clear, and compelling. If
there was one thing that Will hung his hat on,
it was that he was a faithful follower of Jesus
Christ. He wanted people to know about the
life they could have if they would open up their
hearts to the Lord. He generously supported
numerous ministries, including: The Navigators, Young Life, Springs Rescue Mission,
International Students, Inc., and Focus on the
Family. Will and Bessie attended Village
Seven Presbyterian Church for forty-seven
years. Will faithfully sang in the church choir
and encouraged fellow believers to become
engaged in their communities, whether it be
politically or spiritually.
Mr. Perkins truly made the culture of the 5th
Congressional District as beautiful as our natural surroundings. The Colorado Front Range
has lost a Christian statesman, but we will
benefit from Will’s legacy for generations to
come.

Rep. EMANUEL CLEAVER, of Kansas City, Missouri to recognize Travois, Inc:, a Certified B
Corporation headquartered in Kansas City,

honoree by B Lab. Travois focuses exclusively
on promoting housing and economic development for American Indian, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian communities. We are proud
to have this socially and environmentally conscious company in the Kansas City metro region.
Since its establishment in 1995, Travois has
generated $1.4 billion in housing and economic development in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities,
helping clients build or rehabilitate more than
5,400 affordable homes. The company has
brought more than $800 million in private investor equity to more than 200 developments
in Indian Country. Travois raises capital for
this purpose through the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit program, the New Markets Tax
Credit program, and through impact investors.
Travois’ work promotes public benefits, is
designed to solve social and environmental
issues, creates economic opportunity for individuals and communities, and focuses on underserved populations. The company also finances
critical
economic
development
projects, including infrastructure, healthcare,
community centers, education facilities, and
senior living centers in 22 states. Additionally,
it provides employee benefits like on-site
daycare and uses an extensive renewable energy system of rooftop solar panels to power
its headquarters building.
Travois has been honored in two categories
of Best For the World: Overall and Customers.
It earned recognition as Best for the World:
Overall due to its rank in the top 10 percent
of all 3,000 B Corporations worldwide across
all six impact areas—environment, workforce,

Friday, November 1, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and
service of the late Rep. John Conyers, the
longest serving African American in Congress,
a founding member of the Congressional
Black Caucus and the former Dean of the
House.
During his more than 50 years in the House
of Representatives, Rep. Conyers built a reputation as a champion for civil, human and
voting rights. He was relentless: Just four days
after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
killed, Rep. Conyers introduced the first bill to
create a federal holiday honoring him. Fifteen
years later, he finally got it over the finish line
when President Reagan signed it into law in
1983.
Rep. Conyers spent his life advocating for
those who often did not have a seat at the
table. He helped spearhead landmark reforms
including the original passage and several extensions of the Voting Rights Act, as well as
passage of the Violence Against Women Act
of 1994 and the Hate Crimes Act of 2009. In
2002, Rep. Conyers successfully pushed for
the Help America Vote Act, legislation that
made sweeping improvements to voting systems and voter access.
On a personal note, Rep. Conyers also had
ties to my hometown of Selma, Alabama,
where he led a voter registration drive in February 1965, just one month before the Bloody
Sunday Selma to Montgomery march. Rep.
Conyers was in his first year in Congress, but
Dr. King said his ‘‘very presence there has
had an electric effect upon the voteless and
beleaguered Negro citizens of this city, county,
state and nation.’’
Rep. Conyers never waivered in his steadfast support of his beloved Detroit and those
he served. May he rest in peace.

THE IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD
JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES
SPEECH OF

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Thursday, October 31, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, to its credit, the House is demonstrating the seriousness
of steps that could lead to the impeachment of
a president. In my judgment, shameful
breaches of conduct (and Trump has committed many), such as President Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, were not impeachable because official duties were not implicated. For impeachment, the Constitution requires ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ An
affair with an intern is disgraceful, not criminal.
The people are ahead of the Congress on
impeaching this President, or at least on the
inquiry we formalize, if consistent indications
from polls can be counted as evidence. The
House is taking the right step in ratifying the
inquiry process that will lead to the necessary
open hearings.
As a member of the Oversight and Reform
Committee, I have been sitting in on closed
hearings from witnesses whose testimony is
part of the prescribed process. The prosecutor, the House, is conducting an inquiry,
which is like a grand jury proceeding or a U.S.
Attorney investigation to determine if there has
been a violation of law. These procedures are
always closed to protect the innocent parties
in case the decision is made that there is not
enough evidence to move forward. So far, witnesses have come forward to corroborate evidence indicating that Trump used his office as
president to seek ‘‘a favor,’’ an investigation of
his most prominent opponent in the forthcoming election, by a foreign power who had
life or death dependence on the appropriated
U.S. funds.
Was there an attempt made to hold security
funding hostage to the president’s concern
about a political rival? If this question is
deemed not to be worthy of the inquiry—investigation—we authorize today, it would be
difficult to ever again define any conduct that
deserves an impeachment inquiry.

Thursday, October 31, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 660.
This is only the fourth time in its 230-year
history, the House of Representatives is voting
to authorize a public inquiry into whether to
exercise one of the most solemn responsibilities of Congress: impeachment of the President of the United States.
Under the Constitution, the criteria for impeachment and removal from office are ‘‘treason, bribery, or other high crimes and mis-

demeanors.’’ While the Constitution does not
define the scope of ‘‘high crime and misdemeanors,’’ Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers that impeachable offenses
are those that arise ‘‘from the abuse or violation of some public trust’’ and ‘‘relate chiefly to
injuries done immediately to the society itself.’’
The House determined in 1988 that high
crimes and misdemeanors are not necessarily
criminal acts but rather ‘‘misconduct that damages the state and the operation of government institutions.’’
Last month, a whistle blower alleged that
the President had used the power of his office
to solicit interference from a foreign country in
the 2020 election by withholding congressionally approved security assistance for Ukraine
to coerce them to investigate a political opponent. If true, these allegations are impeachable offenses that threaten the very core of
our system of government.
What we have learned since our inquiry
began on September 24th is deeply troubling.
Numerous government officials, both political
appointees and career diplomats, have testified under oath how the President’s personal
lawyer ran a shadow foreign policy to benefit
the President’s reelection at the expense of legitimate foreign policy objectives.
With today’s resolution, the House will move
into the public phase of the inquiry. The Resolution ensures a fair and transparent process
that allows the Majority and the Minority equal
time to question witnesses and permits the
President’s attorneys to present their case,
question witnesses, and make requests for additional evidence or testimony. These protections are the same or greater than the ones
provided to Presidents Nixon and Clinton during the inquiries into their behavior.
I don’t take today’s vote lightly because I
served in Congress during the impeachment
of President Clinton. I know firsthand how divisive impeachment can be. However, our democracy cannot function under these circumstances, and my oath to defend the Constitution calls me to support this inquiry.
When Benjamin Franklin was asked whether
the newly drafted Constitution established a
monarchy or a republic, he replied ‘‘a Republic, if you can keep it.’’ Each generation of
Americans is called to uphold the principles of
self-governance, and when those we elect to
public office violate our laws and our Constitution, faith in our democracy erodes.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution so the American people can hear firsthand how the President abused the power of
his office to solicit interference from a foreign
country in the 2020 election. My oath of office
is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and I will continue to do everything I can to live up to this
sacred pledge and keep the republic the
Founding Fathers built for us.
