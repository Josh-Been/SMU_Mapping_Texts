Blessed are you, O Lord
My soul exalts in the Lord
A babe in Mary's arms
[A Babe Is Born]
A Babe is born all of a maid
A Babe is born in Bethlehem
A babe was born, a little one
I have a baby sister
When that our gentle Lord was born
A band of children, Jesus
A band of dear children go marching along
We'll work for Jesus today
A band of herdsmen tarried late
There's a beautiful garden yonder
There is a bright land far over the sea
There's a beautiful land, where no sorrow is known
There's a beautiful mansion on yonder bright shore
When life is over, my labors laid down
There's a river of life, O beautiful fountain
A beauty hides in ev'ryone
[A Beggar-King Comes Riding]
A better day is coming, the morning draweth nigh
This old world is filled with sorrow, sin is ev'rywhere
We meet to worship our dear Savior in the spirit of sweet song
Ever since I have been Living in a world of sin
I've a better home in glory
I am going to a home
I'm satisfied with Christ alone
Are you sinning day by day
A birthday greeting to you, dear
May the Lord always bless you and keep you
God's grace upon this house descend
May you hear the angels sings
Someone has need of our singing
A blessing on our pastor's head
[A Blind Man Sat Beside the Road]
A blood red rose reminds us still
A Boy is born in Bethlehem
A boy was born in Bethlehem (Talbot)
A boy was born in Bethlehem, With tiny hands and downy head
[A Branch Connected to the Vine]
A brighter dawn is breaking
Lord, my heart is prone to wander
[A Broken Spirit]
[A Bush Bursts into Flame]
A butterfly 
At home and abroad, on life's battlefield
There's a call for volunteers
Hark! over the tumult of cares
A calm and gentle quiet reigns tonight
There's a little light that's burning
We join our glad exultant voices
Lord, hear our prayer. Lord, hear our prayer
[A Centurion From Capernaum]
[A Certain Place]
Thrill me, still me, fill me with Thy power
A cheering, chanting, dizzy crowd
A child, a youth, a man
A child for us is born this day
A Child is born in Bethlehem
A child is born in Bethlehem, Alleluia
A child is born in Bethlehem, alleluia!
A child is born in Bethlehem, Alleluia (Puer natus in BÃ©thlehem, AllelÃºia)
A child is born, the birth proclaim
Praise the Lord! My heart with his love is beaming,
A child of man, a child of God
My Father is rich in houses and lands
A child of the King! O calling divine!
I have lost my doubt, and my sin and fear
I love Thee Lord, with all my heart
A child will lead the dawn of grace
A children's temple here we build
God, make my life a little light
We thank thee, God, for food we eat
O give us homes built firm upon the Savior
The sweetness of a Christian life
In the purple depth of Heaven
Far from home thy Christmas keeping
A city of exceeding strength
[A City Radiant as a Bride]
The towering buildings close around;
You said: Take this bread and eat of Me
Gathered 'round Your table on this holy eve
The body broken, the blood shed
Why, Lord, must evil seem to get its way
All unseen the Master walketh
When on a summer's sultry day
If the roses had no petals
A crown of gold surpassing rare
There's a cry from Macedonia Come and help us
From darkness and chaos, from fashionless void
[A Dab of Earthly Things]
There's a day of coronation
A debtor to mercy alone
[A Den For the Fox]
O Savior, let thy kingdom come, And thy dear will, O Lord, be done
Tell us, O women travelers
Thou art, O Christ, the everlasting Son!
A dread hath come on me
One night I dreamed of flying high up in the middle of the air
Dear friends, farewell, I go to dwell
Why was unbelieving I
He dies, the Heavenly Lover dies
He waters the hills with rains from the skies
There was a man named Saul whose name was changed to Paul
[A Family Sleeps a Deep, Contented Sleep]
Fly, Earth's gaudy, fading trifles
Far, far on the ocean
A father came to Jesus
Father in love
Jesus, Lord, remember me
O Lord, I humbly come to You
A few more days on earth to spend
A few more years of toil and care
A few more years shall roll
A fisher of men
I sought a flag to follow
I am a foot-soldier
A Fount of mercy, Lord, Thou art
There's a fountain for the cleansing of the soul
A fox has a den
A friend have I who standeth near
Who amid the swelling billows
When you need someone to help you as you tread life's rugged way
Jesus is a Friend indeed, mighty friend in time of need
I have a Friend whose love entwines
A Friend of mine is Jesus
Thru this busy earthly life, filled with trouble, sin and strife
My Life's a Shade, my Days apace decline
Time was I was up at dawn and eager for the field
That we may give our all
[A Gentile Woman Came to Christ to Glean]
Jesus has heard my plea
A pilgrim I to Canaan flee
Thru the madness and the sadness, heartaches and the strife
While wand'ring in the darkest night alone and burdened sore
Keep a gleam of sunshine
There are dreary hours when my heart is sad
Do you hear them coming, brother?
A glorious day is dawning
All glory be unto You, Lord
A glorious theme my raptur'd heart inspires
A glory fills the midnight sky
It's a good enough book for me
On that eternal morning in yonder land
A goodly theme is mine
A gospel-wave is sweeping 'round me
A grain of corn an infant's hand
When a grain of wheat
A grateful heart a garden is
A grateful heart is what I bring
By God's grace we were blessed to have heroes strong and true
Won't that be a great home-coming over on the other shore
What a great salvation has been sent to earth
A guilty, weak and helpless worm
Since the blessed Saviour sought me when I went astray
A halo rests upon Thy brow
A hand divine held out to me
There is a happy band on earth today
When I gave my heart to Jesus
There is work for all to do
I am bound for the land of the living
I have longed for a beautiful home here below
Brother, over there the bells are ringing
I've found a happy religion and a new region
Happy are the souls who trust in Jesus today
My body is weak, overtaken by the fall
There's a haven of rest for you and me
I want, dear Lord, a heart that's true and clean
I have heard of a beautiful City
A heavenly splendour from on high
[A Holy Baby]
There's a home beyond the river
I've a home in the sky, where I'll live bye and bye
There's a home of delight on an evergreen shore
We read of a City where death cannot come
A font of God's love overflowing
A hundred years ago, not one
[A Hundred Years! How Small A Part]
Where! Where will be the birds that sing
Mourn, mourn, ye saints as if you see
While midnight shades the earth o'erspread
A hymn of glory let us sing
A hymn of glory let us sing
A hymn of glory let us sing
Dear God, Parent of Humankind
Brother, thou hast not died
A is for anyone who's not afraid to die
Assist us, Lord, thy name to praise
A just man honored from above
[A King on High Is Reigning]
A king put on a feast
A lamb alone bears willingly
A Lamb bears all its guilt away
A Lamb goes forth: the sins He bears
A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth
A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth, The guilt of all men bearing
A lamb goes uncomplaining forth
Do you hear the Shepherd calling?
A lamp for our feet has been given
When sin-sick and weary, how often
There's a land of beauty, just across the river
A leaf tossed by the sea
 Praise God throughout these forty days
A life together in love and troth
I rushed at life with hopes all burning
There's a deep, silent river flowing just before
When the earth was fill'd with darkness
A light from heaven shone around
There's a light in the cloud hanging over the way
I have toiled thru the years 'mid the sorrow and tears
A light rises in the darkness for the upright
A light to lighten the Gentiles
We've journeyed many a day
Mary and Joseph
A little bit of blowing
Do you know the world is dying
This old world is filled with trouble, sorrows often press us sore
A little child is born tonight
A little child may know
A little child so fair and bright
A little child the Savior came
My heart is closer drawn to Jesus, day by day
By making someone happy as we pass along life's way
A little Lamb bears all the guilt
A little more giving, a little less greed
"A little Sanctuary" art Thou to me
A little ship was on the sea
Just a little talk with Jesus, How it smooths the rugged road!
My brother, I remember when I was a sinner lost
A little talk with Jesus makes it right, all right
A little that the righteous hold
O for the Peace which floweth like a river
A little while the cross to bear
A little while to tarry here
A little while! so quickly flee earth's shadows
A little while longer I'll wait here below
A little while longer, "the heat and the burden"
When you find life unkind and there's nothing really left for you
A living freedom never dies
The promise of salvation now is ours
A living, loving, lasting word
A living sacrifice
I love the Christ, the Son of God
O child of God, "why weepest thou?"
A lonely boat set out to sea
A long, long way we've come today
A long-lost lamb is in the fold
A lost and sinful world to save
In mercy Jesus looked on me
In holiness brilliant, in righteousness bright
Mid the throng in which I'm daily living
[A Man Had Been Robbed of All He Had]
[A Man Heard God Speak Painful News]
A man lay beaten, left for dead
A man named Nicodemus to Jesus came one night
[A Man Named Zacchaeus]
A Man there lived in Galilee
O'er my spirit tonight
There's a mansion of love in a city above
I to JEHOVAH with my voice
Make me, Lord, a means of your peace
In my soul I have a sweet melody to sing
There's a melody that's ringing in my soul today
Near to thy mercy seat, O God
A message from our Father
There's a message of love
A messenger is calling
There are many souls in darkness living
A meteor bright its wondrous light
A might wind sweeps through the ages
There's a mighty army marching on to glory
A mighty fortress is our God
A mighty fortress is our God
A mighty fortress is our God
A mighty Fortress is our God
A mighty fortress is our God
A mighty fortress is our God
A mighty Fortress is our God, A trusty Shield and Weapon
A mighty fortress is our Lord, A sure defense to save us
The Saints have been weeping, praying for years
A mighty sound from heaven
A mighty stronghold is our God
A mighty wind invades the world
Poor sinners you are born to die
To say farewell to friends today
I've felt a new and loving touch
You must give and take, forgive, forsake
Awake, my soul, awake mine eyes
See how the morning sun
Jesus, have Thy way in my life today
Lord, in the morning I will send
A morning star draws near the earth
A mother lined a basket
A Mountain Fastness is our God
A multitude comes from the east and the west
The Lord God now be with you
A name there is that gives me greatest pleasure
O holy Child of Bethlehem!
A never-failing friend
A new advent of joy
A new blessing, dear Lord, dear Lord, for me
Once I wandered all alone in dark despair
There is joy among the angels when a sinner comes repenting
A new commandment I give unto you
[A New Commandment]
We are not alone, we live in God's world
When the day seems long and dreary, and the pathway without cheer
In this life we have no lasting joy
Lord, I come now before You, to lay my life at Your feet
With a contrite heart to the Lord I came
I was once a sinner, but I came 
There's a new name written down in glory
Sing God a new song
I know not the song of Thy praises
A new year God has given
May God satisfy your longing
Let us tell the world what Jesus
Father, bless us as we go
Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing, Send it to us from above
A parting hymn we sing
[A Party For John]
Give me a passion for souls, dear Lord
Set my heart, dear Father, on Thee and Thee only
A peaceful walk upon our earth
Father, Thy servant is calling Thee now
Bless the Lord Who reigns in beauty
A perfect path of purest grace
Holy One, Jesus Christ
There's sunshine and roses, there's head and the cold
I have a picture, stamped in my soul
I have heard of the valleys and mountains
A pilgrim and a stranger
A pilgrim am I and a stranger
A pilgrim here I wander
For ev'ryone born, a place at the table
A place called home with comfort for the weary
Lord, in thee am I confiding
O Christ Divine, uplift my sight
My life I draw, Lord, from Thy Death
Abide with me Lord, in mercy
Be with me, Lord, where'er I go
Dear Lord I pray all care to cease
Our Father in heaven, bless us who unite
Here we would see Jesus, wearied with the journey
Grace, dear Lord, grace, dear Lord
Lord, let me love; let loving be the symbol
I thank you God for Mother dear
God, we have heard it, sounding in the silence
Jesus, we plead in one accord
In the upper room at Jerusalem
O Lord of earth and sky and sea
O Lord, bow down thine ear
Bow down, O Lord, thine ear
LORD, Thou hast been our dwelling place
Thou Lord our stay hast been
O LORD, now hear my mournful pray'r
Lord Jesus, may I always be
Lord, give me a praying spirit
With heart and lips unfeign'd
[A Presence on the Sea]
A present God is all our strength
Beautiful and dear the promise, coming to my soul today
A Prophet-woman broke a jar
Behold a lovely vine
LORD, I will thee extol on high
Come, let us sing unto the Lord
O God, thy judgments give the King, Thy justice likewise to his son
O God, Thy judgments give the King
How amiable, Lord of hosts
The God of GODS, the LORD doth speak
O to the mighty God our strength
Sure God is good to Israel
The mighty God, Jehovah spake
JEHOVAH in thy strength
God of my righteousness to me
Jehovah, to my words give ear
O Lord, rebuke me not in wrath
O LORD, our Lord, in all the earth
LORD I'll Thee praise with all my heart
Help, O JEHOVAH now, because
Fools in their hearts say, there's no GOD
JEHOVAH hearken to the right
JEHOVAH hear thee in the day
The earth is all the LORD's
Judge me, O LORD, as I have walk'd
The LORD my light and SAFETY is
O LORD, my rock, to Thee I cry
O ye the sons of mighty ones
In Thee, O LORD, I put my trust
O blessed is the man to whom
O thou my soul, JEHOVAH bless
Hold not thy peace, O GOD my praise
Of mercy and of judgment I
LORD strive with them who with me strive
I said, I to my ways will look
With expectation from the LORD
Fools in their heart say, there's no GOD
O GOD, thine ear give to my pray'r
Give ear, O GOD, to my loud cry
Truly my waiting soul on GOD
O LORD, thou dost me search and know
LORD, save me from malicious men
O LORD, to Thee I call aloud!
LORD, hear my humble pray'r to Thee
O let JEHOVAH blessed be
With all my heart I'll Thee confess
Lord, I'll thee praise, with all my heart
O Lord our Lord, in all the earth
O ye the sons of mighty ones
The trespass of the wicked man
JEHOVAH to my Lord hath said
My God, my God, wherefore hast thou
LORD in thy wrath rebuke me not
Why gloriest thou in injury
In all the seasons of my life
Lord, how my troubles multiply?
O GOD, Thou art my God, I will
O God, have mercy upon me
O save me in thy name, O GOD
O LORD my God, I wholly place
Shout to JEHOVAH al the earth
Lord, thou didst signal favors show
Let GOD be merciful to us
To Thee, JEHOVAH, thanks to give
LORD, God, my saviour, day and night
To thee, O God, we render thanks, To Thee with praise repair
O Mighty GOD, hear Thou the voice
Silence! For Thee, the praise O GOD
Let GOD arise, and all his foes
A pure heart create for me, O Lord
A purple robe, a crown of thorn
A rabbi sat against a wall
A race on earth, a race we run
When the clouds of sin are o'er you, and the way is dark before you
Has life's burdens today weighed heavy on you
I waited for the Lord my God, Yea, patiently drew near
Is this a theme of mirth? who can rejoice
A rest here have I never
Revive thy work, O Lord, And manifest Thy power
A rhyme, a rhyme, for Easter time
A rich young man came seeking
[A Righteous God in Heaven Reigns]
Beauty ever ancient and new
O seek a rock to build on
I turn when afflicted with grief
A Roman centurion sought out the Lord
Rose is blooming, rose is blooming
When this life is ended, and my work is done
A safe stronghold our God is still
When I'm standing some day at the bar on high
A Saviour wonderful is He, beyond my fondest dreaming
A seedling of Jesse shall flower
The Lord's our rock, in him we hide
[A Shepherd With a Hundred Sheep]
You, O Lord, are a shield about me
A ship comes richly laden
A Shoot Shall Come Forth
A shoot will spring from Jesse's stump
Physician of my sin-sick soul
A simple word of grace is all I need
A single grain of wheat
A single unmatched stone
Long have I walked this dreary road
Jesus died upon the tree
O my Lord, what must I do
O ye pilgrims, sing an exhortation
A song and a carol for Christmastide
His ground works in the holy hills
The Lord his sacred house doth on
Soft white snowflakes, gently falling
There's a song in my heart since Jesus saved me
There's an ache in my heart that the world cannot heal
O Jesus Lord, most fair, most passing sweet
A song floated down through the silence of night
A million more would like to sing
When the days are gloomy, sing a song of cheer
Is God for me? t'oppose me
I ask, O Lord, in smiple faith
Glorify the Lord, all you works of the Lord
I in distress cry'd to the LORD
Behold, bless ye the Lord, Ye the Lord's servants all
Lord from the deeps I cried to thee
Now from may youth my Israel say
O blest is every one
It was my joy to hear them say
I joyed in them that said to me
Had not the LORD been on our side
We have a song of gladness, taking the place of sadness
I am sweetly singing
I go from grief and sighing
Salvation's free, glad joy of all
Joy! Joy! Joy! There's a song of joy for you
This happy song of joy each morning, noon and night
Sweet peace is in my soul today
Good matter springs up in my heart
O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven
Almighty Lord Most High draw near
Even when young, I prayed for wisdom's grace
Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers
Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers
Lord, we remember your people
Blest be my God that I was born
In Thy tabernacle, Lord, I offer
Does the raindrop doubt the ocean
Wisdom freed from a nation of oppressors
Wisdom freed a holy people
O all ye lands, with shouts of joy
O GOD, my heart is fix'd; I'll sing
Thereâ€™s a song of wondrous beauty
Splendor and honor and kingly power
I hear the Gospel's joyful sound
A Sower came from ancient hills
[A Sower Went Forth to Sow, He Did]
A sower's seed fell on a path
A spark of that ethereal fire
A special star, a special star
A spendthrift lover is the Lord
A stable lamp is lighted
A star at dawn, bubble in a stream
[A Star Not Mapped on Human Charts]
A star shone bright across the plain
A still small voice in the heart of the city
A story most lovely I'll tell
A story of old tells how Jesus came
[A Stranger, Knocking on a Door]
A stranger, starving on the street
We're just a sunset nearer
A sure and tried foundation stone
A sure stronghold our God is He
I'll tell you a tale of the olden time
Sometimes the Savior leads me on
Take me now, Lord Jesus, take me
You go to stand a test in judgment
The Lord be thanked for his gifts
Almighty Sovereign of the skies
How weak, how languid is th'immortal mind!
The cares of mortal life, how vain!
We light a thousand candles bright
A thousand wants thy path attend
A thousand years have come and gone
Press along O children of the Lord
O the wondrous story of a Savior's love
While journeying through this humble vale
A time to be born, a time to die
I was lost, sad and lone when for help I cried
Christ's is the world in which we move
A tower of safety is our God, His sword and shield defend us
A traveler unknown to me
[A tree there grew in Eden's glade]
All alone in the evening grey
A-va-tam-sak-a, the Mystic!
A vacant place at the table
A virgin did come from lowliest home
A virgin pure, both meek and mild
A vision seen, a call obeyed
A voice, a heavenly voice I hear
A voice by Jordan's shore
Console my people, the ones dear to me
A voice from the billow is calling
A voice from the desert comes awful and shrill
A voice was heard in Ramah
A wedding took place in the village of Cana
When the day shall close and my work is done
Some glad tomorrow I'll fly away
Once I struggled with a burden
Lord, let Thy Spirit, from earthly passion weaning
Oh! once there was a wicked, wicked man
A wiggly, waggly worm, a slipp'ry, slimy slug
We are a wilderness wandering people
You are saved to be a winner of souls
[A Woman Came Who Knew and Paid]
[A Woman in the Crowd]
A woman knelt where Jesus sat to eat
A woman of valor who can find?
A woman stood accused
[A Woman Stood Before Her God]
A woman was sick
A woman who did not count the cost
I have a friend, oh, a wonderful friend
I know of a Name heard o'er the earth
Sing unto the Lord, his praises loud proclaim
I'm holding my Savior's nail-scarred hand
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus
'Tis a wonderful song which my soul now sings
Oh, wonderful story of ages
I am going some day to the beautiful city
I am happy today, thinking of that new home
A wondrous mystery is here
Only a word by somebody heard
Let me speak a word for Jesus
A word of prayer when the day begins
[A World In Pain, A Baby's Cry]
This is a world of beauty
A world of sinners once was drowned
I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted
God wants me to be good
[A Wounded Man Lay by the Road]
A year, another year is fled
A year of God's favor Christ promised, and more
Utterly abandoned to the Holy Ghost!
"Abba, Abba, hear us," we cry
"Abba Father, Abba Father,"
[Abba, Father]
Mold us, mold us and fashion us
Father hold me safe in Your arms
Abba, Father, let me be
Abide among us with Thy grace
Lord, I have taken my cross to follow Thee
Abide in grace, Lord Jesus
These words the Master told
Abide, O dearest Jesus
Abide with me: fast falls the eventide
To thee, O Lord, we come for light
Abide with me, dear Spirit
Abide with me, my Savior blest
Fix a dwelling, Lord, in Goshen
Abide with us, Lord Jesus
Abide with us, our Savior
Abide with us, the day is waning
Though troubles great o'ershadow me
O Saviour dear, Thou Lord of Light
Jesus, Thou rock of ages
He was not willing that any should perish
Able to deliver! sound it far and near
God so loved the world, when in darkness 'twas lost
Able to save, able to keep
He's able to keep you from falling
Such a wonderful Redeemer I have found
Jesus is able to save from sin
Help us, O God, to create a new future
I heard a sweet old story
[Above All]
In the bosom of the Father
Above me hangs the silent sky
[Above the Clash of Creeds]
Above the clear blue sky
Above the moon earth rises
[Above the Starry Spheres]
Above the trembling elements
Abraham journeyed to a new country
[Abraham, Sarah Too]
Abroad in the meadows, to see the young lambs
Absolutely free
There's a story wonderful, true
Absolutely tender, absolutely true
There's a promise I have found
Our service for God has been barren and dry
We cannot own the sunlit sky
Lord Jesus, I have found in Thee
Abundantly satisfied, under his wing
O brother, the millions are dying in sin
My body, soul, and spirit
Accept, O God, the gifts we bring
Accept, O Lord, the gifts we bring
Accept our evening prayer
Would you know your sins forgiv'n
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
Jesus has given his life for us
Rejoice, rejoice, child of God!
May the peace of Christ rule in your hearts
Christ has died
We praise you, O Lord, we bless you
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you
Accommodating others is kind of fun to do
Not what I wish to be
According to thy gracious word
According to your mercy, Lord
Ach sehet, welch ein mensch!
Achieving disagreement can be a pleasant thing
Across the eastern hilltops gleam
Across the plains one Christmas night
I've a home across the river
There's a home across the river
Across the sky the shades of night
How shall we come before you?
Oh, my God, I am sorry for my sins
With humble hands now clasped
After believing, come confessing
In trouble and in thrall
Adam in Paradise was placed
Adam's Complaint
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God
Lord, you are holy indeed
Glory and praise to you, O Christ
Good and gracious God, hear and remember us
Adieu to earth with all your joy
Adon olom a'sher molach
[Adoration]
O Christ my Lord, my heart shall sing
Adored by the acclaiming crowd
Adored for ever be the Lord
Adoremus te Jesu Christe (Let us praise your name, God our Saviour)
O come let us join, Together combine
Adrift tonight and awash
Lord, show us your mercy and love
As he comes, the Virgin's Son
You are the joy of ev'ry human heart
Here in this world where darkness surrounds us
A time for hope!
You raise us to new life
Light the Advent Candle, one
Hear the advent song of the angel throng
Advent tells us Christ is near
Christ came to bring us salvation and has promised to come again
Now is the time, O lovely youth
Afar in the desert of sorrow and sin
Give to the Lord ye Potentates
Affirm anew the threefold name
I will follow in God's name when Jesus calls to me
Afflictions, though they seem severe
After the winter, so cold and so drear
After the Christian's tears
The world of forms and changes is just now so confused
As I travel thro' this unfriendly land
Although our lives be filled with bliss
After a while the trump will sound
After the sunshine comes the rain, after the gladness, grief and pain
Thus was the great Redeemer plunged
After darkness, light
Earthly life will soon be ended
After the conflict all is over
When all my labors have ended in this cold world here blow
After the midnight, there will be dawning
After the night of sorrow after the night of sorrow
Raindrops are falling from the clouds over head
After the stormy times, the calmness comes
After this journey is ended, and with Jesus we're truly ascended
After Three Days Thou Didst Rise
We shall lose our grief and care

Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!
I have wasted too many years in pleasure and sin
[Around God's Throne the Rainbow Shines]
Around the corner, around the world
Around the throne of God
Around the throne of God a band
Around the throne of God I heard
Around the throne of God in heaven
Around the throne of grace we meet
Around thy table, holy Lord, In fellowship we meet
Around you, O Lord Jesus
[Around your table, Christ, we sing]
Array'd in beauteous green
Arrayed against our church and faith
We are come unto Mount Zion
O my brother, art thou drifting, Drifting toward a sea
Art thou hung'ring for the fulness
Art Thou Weary, Art Thou Languid
As a bird at dawning singeth
As a bird in meadows fair
As a chalice cast of gold
As a deer in want of water
As a fire is meant for burning
As a mother for her children
As a mother holds her baby
A call for loyal soldiers
As above the darkest storm cloud
As Abraham and Sarah
As after the water-brooks panteth
As at Pentecost you came
[As Bright As Lightning]
As channels of thy healing grace
As children, we may learn to love
As comes the breath of spring
As darker, darker, fall around
As dawn awakes another day
As deer long for the streams, O Lord
As dew falls gently at dawn
As did the Christ, we'll undertake
As drops the gentle rain from heaven
As each happy Christmas
As earth turns toward light
As evening brings the close of day
As fair as the lilies, as spotless as snow
[As Far as West lies from the East]
As flows the river, calm and deep
[As for Me and My House]
As for me and my house, we will all serve the Lord
As for me and my house, we will serve You, Lord
As from the winter sky
[As Grain on Scattered Hillsides]
As grains of wheat are gathered in
As he gathered at his table
Just to do His will with a happy heart
[As High As the Heavens]
For His anger lasts only a moment
As I am inside and outside
As I am, O Jesus, take me
I am laying my treasures up in the sky
As I in the early morning
There is gladness in my soul, pressing onward to the goal
Jesus, I look upon Your hands
I will work as I ought to work
As if you were not there
As in that upper room you left your seat
As in the days of Haggai when

As Jacob with travel was weary one day
As Jesus close against the rood
As Jesus took leave of his mother

As Jonah, Issuing from His Three Days' Tomb
As lately we watched o'er our flocks through the night
[As Lazarus Slipped Toward Silence]
As light, O Christ, Thou cam'st to earth
As longs the deer for cooling streams
As man and woman we were made
For as many as received Him
As Mary walked in the garden green
As morning breaks from night
As morning dawns, Lord, hear our cry
As Moses, lost in Sinai's wilderness
As Moses raised the serpent up
With my burden of transgression
As newborn stars were stirred to song
As Nicodemus came by night
As now the sun shines down at noon
As now the sun's declining rays
As on a hill-top gained at last
[As On Hillsides Wrapped in Silence]
As on the cross the Saviour hung
As on the night before this happy morn
As once for Jonah, so the Lord
As panting deer desire the waterbrooks
As pants the chased, thirsty hart
As pants the deer for flowing streams
As pants the deer for living streams
Far from thy sacred courts my tears
O, why art thou cast down, my soul
As pants the for cooling springs, So longs my soul, O King of Kings
As pants the Hart for cooling Streams, When heated in the Chace (Hopkinson)
As pants the hart for streams of living water
As pants the hart to taste the limpid flood
As pants the wearied hart for cooling springs
As Rachel mourned her children
[As Rain from the Clouds]
But man rebels, and for one tast doth choose
As saints of old their firstfruits brought
As seemeth best to Thee, my God
As servants working an extate
As shadows lengthen and the night grows cold
[As Six-Winged Seraphs Volleyed Praise]
As sons of the day and daughters of light
As stewards of a vineyard
As the birds of the air
As the Bread of Life Is Broken
As the chas'd hart with vehemence
As the dark awaits the dawn
Let your light shine bright o'er the restless wave
Let us speak some word as we pass along the way
My soul is thirsting
As the deer pants for the water
As the deer pants for the water (Scheer)
As the deer pants for the waters
As the deer runs to the river
[As the Deer Seeks Flowing Rivers]
As the disciples, when thy Son had left them
As the glory of creation
As this cup of blessing
As the hart, about to falter
There's a crying void
As the hart longs for flowing streams
As the hart, with eager looks
As the lyre to the singer

As the restless hart is longing
As the running deer seeks the flowing brook
As the serpent raised by Moses
As the sun doth daily rise
As the sun with longer journey
As the waters cover the sea
As the winter days grow longer
As the years roll on, and the sun sinks low
As thirsts the hart for water brooks
As those who seek the break of day
As Thou didst say--the Spirit came
As Thou, O Lord, hast made me strong
"As thy days thy strength shall be!"
Do thy weary footsteps falter
Jesus wept and groaned in spirit
[As Trees from Tiny Seeds Can Grow]
Dear Lord, as twilight softly falls
[As water to the thirsty]
As we break the bread 
You are the Christ
Now, Dear Lord, as we pray
Our Father in heaven
As we gather may Your Spirit work within us
As we gather around the table
As we gather at your table
As we gather in the kitchen
As we go, may Your Spirit go before us
Now, let our works and virtue show
As we leave this friendly place
As we part for the towns and cities
Windfall of way-bread, scattered on sand
As we remember, Lord, thy faithful handmaid
Let us break bread together with the Lord!
As we walk along beside you
[As We Walked Home at Close of Day]
As we, your people, gather
As when the weary traveler gains
As wide as the skies is thy mercy, O God
As with gladness men of old
As you go on your way, may God go with you
As you, go, tell the world
You can make the dark days light
As your family Lord, meet us here
Ascend thy throne, almighty King

[Ascension Song]
[Ascribe Greatness]
[Ascribe to the Lord]
Ascribe to the Lord our God
Glory, glory to you, O Lord!
Ashamed of Christ, my soul disdains
Ashamed of Thee! O dearest Lord
We rise again from ashes
Sound the trumpet in Zion (We abide in the shadow)
Ask, and thy prayer with arrow's speed
Ask, and ye shall receive
Ask and ye shall receive
Now hear our prayer, O Lord
Ask! Ask! Ask! and it shall be given
Ask and it will be given to you
[Ask, Seek, Knock]
If a child should ask for bread
Ask and it shall be given unto you
When two or three are gathered in His name
Ask ye what great thing I know
Yet, mighty God, indulge my tongue
Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!
Among His people God is known
Thou shalt purge me, O Lord, with hyssop
Vain world, be gone, nor vex my heart
Assemble, ye faithful, be joyful, and triumph
Assembled in Thy house of prayer
Assuming there's peace when really there's none
My soul is grieved because my foes
Can we know that Jesus saves us
"At an hour that ye think not" the Master will come
Thou wilt keep me my Saviour for Thyself alone
See how the willing converts trace
Years I spent in vanity and pride
[At Cana's Wedding, Long Ago]
Give and forgive at Christmas time
Until another Sabbath day
At dead of night sleep took here flight
At early dawn, with pious thought
At Easter morn the lark, ascending
When Easter to the dark world came
At even, when the sun was set
Now it is evening
At every motion of our breath
Make up thy jewels, Lord, and show 
When shades of night in silence fall
At his call the dead awaken
[At Jacob's Well, Where Jesus Sat]
At Jesus' feet our infant sweet
Give them at least one chance to hear
At length, by certain proofs, 'tis plain
At length the wished for spring is come
Who is sleeping? Who is watching?
Lord, when together here we meet
At peace with all creation
I think I should mourn o'er my sorrowful fate
At the beautiful gate to the City of gold
At the close of day
Oh Lord you've searched me
Life eternal's offered thee
At the Cross! At the Cross! where I first saw the light
At the cross her station keeping
At the cross her station keeping
At the cross her vigil keeping
There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies
At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Thro' a shadow land, over desert sand
At the dawning of creation
At the dawning of salvation
At the end of lifeâ€™s road
At the end of our journey
When our race on earth forever is run and we reach at last the setting of sun
I am on my way
There'll be light in the sky, from the palace on high
Does your pathway seem dreary as you travel along?
At the end of the way
As I labor here below, with my neighbor, friend and foe
In this world we are oft made to wonder
There is mercy full and free
There is a peace which you may know along your way
At the font we start our journey
At the foot of the cross â€“ I can hardly take it in
I met Jesus at the foot of the cross
I have cast all my care on Jesus
Soul in despair, there is peace now for thee
I'm standing on the mountain
Jesus, Lord and Master, Thou art love divine
At the golden gate our lov'd are waiting
At the homecoming of the ransomed
At hour of silent midnight
[At the Lamb's High Feast We Sing]
At the learning curve's beginning
Thy manger is
Again we gladly meet at the Redeemer's feet
There is coming a happy time after while
Well met, dear friends, in Jesus' name
Amid the toils and cares of life, Amid the turmoil and the strife
At the name of Jesus
At the name of Jesus
At the name of Jesus evâ€™ry knee should bow
He emptied himself, as a slave, yet free
On the cross the Savior died
Have you come to the Red Sea place in your life
At the portals of light
At the table of the world
Jesus calls, your heart would win
At the Well of Life, O Lord
Earth could not contain the treasures
At thy feet I bow adoring
At Your feet, O Lord, we wait for You
At Your feet we fall, mighty risen Lord
At Your name
[Attend, All Heaven and Earth]
Attend, my ear, my heart, rejoice
Attend, ye heavens
Attend my people to my Law, And to my words incline
Up, sound your joyful songs victorious
O Monica, blest mother
Author of every work divine
Author of faith, appear
Author of Faith, eternal Word
Author of life divine
See, in the woodland, the leaves
A maiden most gentle and tender we sing
Awake! Ye sleepers one and all
Awake, all Buddhist people
Awake, all who sleep, and arise from the dead
Awake and arise, O ye slumbering nations!
[Awake and Live]
Awake and praise the matchless Savior who forever keeps us strong
Raise a happy song to God's glory

Awake, my soul, bestir thee, for the hour is drawing nigh
Awake, my soul, in joyful lays
Awake, my soul, to shout his praise
Awake my soul, with pleasure sing
Awake, Jerusalem, awake
Awake, O Israel
Awake, O man, and from thee shake
Awake, ye souls, that sleep in sin!
Awake, O sleeper, rise from death
Awake, O sleeper, rise from death (Dufner)
Once you were darkness
Awake, O Spirit of the watchmen
Awake, O Spirit of the watchmen
Awake our drowsy souls
Awake, our lute, the child to sing
Awake! the morn is here
Awake, thou careless world, awake!
Art thou now sleeping, sinner friend
Awake, thou Spirit of the martyrs
Awake, thou Spirit, who didst fire
Awake, Thou Spirit, who of old
Awake! ye slumb'ring souls
Arise and shine; O Christian, do not slumber
Awake! dear soul, awake!
Awake with joy, salute the morn!
Awake with joyful strains of mirth
Awake, ye Christian workers, the Master calls for you
Awake, ye guilty souls, awake
Awake, ye nations of the earth
Awake, ye saints, awake
Awake, thou guilty world, awake
Awake, young champ'ons of the cross
Awaken from your idle dreaming
Awaken from your slumber
Awaken, sleepers, sing for joy
Although oppressed by guilt and shame
Away dark thoughts, awake, my joy
Away from his home and the friends of his youth
"Away from us!" the demon cried
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
Away my doubts, begone my fears
Away my unbelieving fear
Away over Jordan, with my blessed Jesus
There is work to do if your heart is true
In the depths of my soul is planted, faith that's bidding me journey on
Away to the harvest field, toilers, away
There is work to be done for the Master above
Away with sorrow's sigh
Our God is an awesome God
As I come into Your presence
Awesome power, boundless grace
Awhile in spirit, Lord, to thee
Ay, ay salidummay
Raise again the bold refrain that tells of mighty deeds
Baby Jesus went to sleep
Babylon streams received our tears
Out in the world's bitter coldness somewhere
There are arms on which we're leaning
Carry me back to Calvary's mountain
Back to Calvary, where Jesus died
When the world is in trouble and anguish and doubt
Back to the blessed old Bible,
O how sore a thing and grievous
Backsliders, who your misery feel
Backward, turn backward, oh, time in your flight
"Bad" is not a name for a woman
Baited, the question rose
Bake a matzo pat! pat! pat!
How blest the righteous are
[Ballad of the Prodigal Son]
Banish each worldy thought
Banned and banished by their neighbors
Baptise us with your Spirit
When John (though a man)
Ploughman, down the narrow field
Come, all ye lovers of the Lamb
Standing in the river Jordan
How large Thy Covenant of Grace
Father in heaven, at the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan
Sing to the Lord, all the earth, tell of God's mercy each day
Declare his works to the nations
All praise to you, eternal Father, through your Son
How lowly is the way
Baptismal waters cover me
"Baptize us with Thy Spirit, Lord"
We are people created
Baptized in living waters
Baptized in water
[Baptized into Christ Jesus]
Baptized into Christ the Lord
Baptized into Thy name most holy
Do you seek a land where there comes no night
It isn't good that some of us are full while some of us are hungry
I had a cat and my cat pleased me
Every day I jump into my little tub
Bathe me in your light 
Bathed in the waters of life
Would you be a sunbeam filled with Heavenâ€™s light
Be a blessing to someone today
Be a blessing ev'ry day
In the world of sin and care, help the blessed One above
Like the song-birds of spring when they gaily sing
O'er the sea, wild and free comes a call to you and me
Be a rock of refuge for me, O Lord
In the world of need about us
Many now are watching the footsteps we take
Be an overcomer, only cowards yield
[Be Blest, O God]
Be bold, be strong
Be doers of the word of God

Be my Shepherd Lord
Valentine, Valentine
You shall cross the barren desert
Be not afraid, 'tis I, 'tis I
Be not afraid, sing out for joy!
Come weal, come woe where'er we go
When trials and temptations Around thee darkly flow
Though you must tread life's lonely road
The Lord hath made a promise faithful
Jesus is a mighty Savior thru the years that come and go
Be not dismayed, thou little flock
Be not far from me, O my strength
Be now imitators of your Lord
When our hearts are glad and light
Be patient but a little while
Oh! a wondrous time is coming unto you
Be present at our table, Lord
Our Father, bless the bounteous store
Be present, Holy Trinity
Be present, Lord, with those you call
Be present, Spirit of the Lord
Be present, ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
When Jesus shall come to gather His own
The Saviour is coming from heaven again
Would you flee from sin and serve the Lord,
Are you walking in the light of God

When troubles come and life is drear
Be still and know that I am God
When the Lord came down from Heaven above
God is a refuge and strength
Be still and know that I am God
Be still, for the presence of the Lord
Be still, God will fight your battles
Be still, my soul; the Lord is on your side
Be still, my soul, before the Lord
Be still, my soul, for God is near!
Be strong!
We are not here to play, to dream, to drift

Be strong in God and in His power
Be strong in Jehovah, though hard be the fight

Be welcome again, God's angels bright
You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High
Be with me, O Lord, in my distress
May the grace of the Lord jesus Christ be with you
Be ye not indolent
Will you tell me why, my brother, in this vale below
Be ye strong in the Lord and the power of His might!
Be you to others kind and true
Yo ho ho, Anybody home?
Lo, the darkness gathers round us
Beam on us brightly, blessed day
Beams of heaven, as I go
Bear the burden of the present
When the shadows gather, and the way is dark and drear
Go tell to souls benighted, of the Lord who came
Bear ye one another's burdens
People of Jesus, trusted to be 
I see my Savior with thorn crowned head
Bearing your cross
Blessed are they that perfect are
Blessed art thou that fearest God
[Beatitudes]
Blest are you, the poor who trust the Father with your lives
The man is blest that God doth feare
Many are the beauties now waiting over yonder
Beautiful robes so white,
Beautiful are the streets of gold
Beautiful band of angels
Beautiful Christ; a Savior true
Beautiful Jesus, bright star of the earth
O'er the hill and adown the snowy dells
Beautiful city, blessed and fair
Beautiful city of gold
I'm thinking today of that city beyond
A crown of thorns my Savior wore
The journey of life may be lonely and drear
Oh, beautiful, beautiful Easter
Look to the world, 'tis a temple fair
O beautiful sunshine gleaming
O glorious homeland just over the line
Beautiful hands that broke the bread
Christ came to His own who were going astray
There is a place of matchless beauty
Over the river by faith I see
Home, Home, beautiful City!
Often I'm heart-sick and sigh for a rest
Over the deep and rolling sea, there is a home prepared for me
O the sun of life is sinking low
O beautiful hour of closing day
Beautiful Jesus
There's a beautiful land waiting over the sea
In that beautiful land when the Savior's adored
When we reach the land of rest, where all the faithful
When we get to glory land, land of beautiful spring
There's a light still brightly shining, from the cross of Calvary
When Jesus our Savior came down from above
Beautiful mansions, home of the blest
Beautiful message of love divine
Beautiful moments, bringing me comfort
Wonderful, so wonderful is Your unfailing love;
When I am weary, discouraged and sad
Beautiful Savior
Beautiful Savior, Wonderful Counselor
Beautiful songs of perfect love, coming from heavenly courts above
Beautiful Sabbath songs, Ringing so glad and free
Jesus is the star of guidance
On stormy seas I sail my bark
When I look on the beautiful stars in the sky
Dark were the clouds of sin that spread above me
Beautiful valley of Eden! 
O, beautiful vision of Jesus!
Beautiful water, Bountiful blessings
There's a glorious world, a world of light
Beauty for ashes my Lord doth prepare
Ring, Joyful bells, from far and near
Because he died and is risen
He died for me on Calvary
Because he has inclined his ear
God sent his Son, they called him Jesus
I believe in the Son
The "Good Shepherd" sought for one lost sheep
My Savior died on Calvary
The Savior came down from heaven one day
O troubled heart, One walks beside thee
[Because He Was the Son of God]
I sing because I love my Lord and want to praise His name
My path may be lonely, and dark be the night
Because I was brought low
Because Jesus felt
Because of who you are, I give you glory
[Because of You]
Because the Saviour prayed that we be one
I want to trust my Savior and do His blessed will
Because thou hast said "Do this for my sake,"
Because Thy mercy is so great
Because thy trust is God alone
Because violence can't end violence
We believe in God, the Father

Because You live, O Christ
Because Your love is better than life
Become to us the living bread
Been so busy praising my Jesus

Before Jehovah's awesome throne
Before Messiahâ€™s presence meet

His oceans all rumble and batter His shore
If you from the Savior have wandered away
Oh, sinner, the Saviour is calling for thee
Oh! Souls now wand'ring from God away

Come and join the singing, while the bells are ringing
Bells of Christmas, ring far and near

Tho the earth be filled with pain and care
Bells of God's mercy are ringing today, calling us from sin's destruction away

Beneath the cross of Jesus
[Beneath the Proud Hills' Shadows]

Many are dreary, footsore and weary
O Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land

Beyond the tide are loved ones waiting
Beyond these walls of worship
Beyond this vale of sorrow
Beyond this world of sin and strife
Words of God, O gift eternal
Bid me of men beware
Whether I cry out your name
Ye gay deceivers of the mind
Big kids, little kids
"Bigger barns are what I need," so a rich man said one day
Far out in the distance by faith I can see
There is only one God

Down the centuries waiting years

Jesus, you're the one I love
Lord Jesus Christ, you are the bread of life

Brethren beloved for Jesu's sake
Brethren, don't you hear the sound?
Brethren farewell, I do you tell
Brethren, the end is near
Brethren, we have met to worship
Brief life is here our portion
Bright and glorious is the sky
Bright and joyful is the morn
Bright as the sun, fair as the moon
Bright burning beams of gospel grace
No days like the days of happy youth
O land of bliss, of grace and glory
There are bright mansions in glory land fair
Bright o'er Bethlehem's lowly mangers
Bright ray whose welcome, vernal beam
Bright scenes of glory strike my sense
Bright the vision that delighted 
Dark clouds so often cast their shadows below
Why should we always be sighing
While trav'ling on the homeward way
Walk with Jesus the King of kings
When the days are dreary and the nights are dark and long
The path of the just is as a shining light
Come ye Christians lift your voice, after while you shall rejoice
Earth seems full of sorrow where'er we go
Brightest and best of the stars of the morning
Brightly gleams our banner
O God, whose Voice hath called us
Bring a gift of love, bring a gift of love
When in the spring the flow'rs are blooming bright and fair
You are salt for the earth, O people
Bring in the Christmas that lights up the ages!
Where armies scourge the countryside
When earthly cares and sorrows roll
Bring the bread, bring the wine
Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear
Bring to the Christ your fears
Bring we the frankincense of our love
God from his heaven is calling today
Here is an orange
Would you know the joy and comfort Jesus gives to souls oppressed?
Are you longing for the fullness of the blessing of the Lord
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse
Christian workers far and wide
Broder Jonah was called to duty
Broken and spilled out
Broken are the gates of death!
Broken cisterns walled in stone
He offered his body, he poured out his soul
For the hungry ones
Broken is the seal of death that bound
All those pieces
Brother and friend, with heart and voice
[Brother Darkness/ Sister Silence]
O brother, you better get ready for the Lord
Brother in Christ, and well beloved
Brother, keep on praying
How pleasant and how good it is
Brother, heed the warning cry
Brother on me rest Thy hand
Live for Jesus every day As we journey on the way
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault
Behold how good and pleasant, And how becoming well
Rich, our God, art Thou in mercy
Bruddah Moses said to Pharaoah
As I tread the narrow way, trusting Jesus ev'ry day
[Build By Faith]
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
What are you building, brother
Build on the Rock, the Rock that ever stands
Build up the city, you builders all
Build up the saints in love
Build us in one body up
Build us up, Lord, build us up
[Build Your City on the Hill]
Foolish man builds on the sinking sand
Build your kingdom here
Builder of ages, planner divine
Building a door through ev'ry wall
I'm working each day for the Master
I builded on Rock, on the Rock of God
I am building on a Rock that will stand the tempest shock
Built by Jehovah's hand
Built on a rock the church of God
Built on the Rock, the church shall stand
Built on the rock of Christ and Christ alone
Burdened with a heavy load, Lord, we come, for Thou art calling
Days are filled with sorrow and care,
Buried in baptism with our Lord
Bruning, burning, brightly burning
Burst, ye emerald gates, and bring
But as many as received Him, to them gave He pow'r
When I was far from God, filled with fear and deep distress
But if Thou wilt not save us here
When the disciples crossed the lake
[But the Fruit of the Spirit]
By a monument of marble
By Adam's fall is all forlorn
By all your saints still striving
Let us labor on by faith still clinging
By and by we're going to see the King
[By Babylon's Waters]
By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored
By every thought of my heart
Following Jesus from day to day,
By faith I live, by faith I see
By faith I stand, O blessed thought
By faith in Christ I walk with God
By faith we are divinely sure
By flowing streams in Babylon
By Fruit, the Ancient Foe's Device
In grace the holy God
By grace I am an heir of heaven
Once I was far from Jesus, a stranger to His grace
By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless
By Grace are ye saved through faith
By grace we know, to us it's clear
By gracious powers so wonderfully sheltered
By His grace I am redeemed
I came to Jesus in sorrow
Deep among the shadows I was drifting here and there
I have plunged beneath the flood
By Jesu's blood-shedding, I happiness gain
By night as on my bed I lay
[By Peter's House]
By roads that wound uphill and down
By sin weighed down, and sorely stricken
By the Babylonian rivers
By the Babylonian waters We sat down and shed our tears
On thy bier how calm thou'rt sleeping
By the blood my Saviour shed upon the tree
[By the Blood of the Lamb]
By the Creator, Joseph was appointed
By the cross of Christ, our Savior
By the gentle waters
By the gracious saving call
THERE'S a road of high adventure
THERE'S a path that's sometimes thorny
In this world of darkness
If I forget thee, Jerusalem
By the sea of crystal
By the thorny way of sorrow
Come, O Spirit, from above
By the waters, the waters of Babylon
We long to play our harps
By the well, a thirsty woman
By Thine own hand the gift was given
By thy blessed word obeying
Daily, Lord, my faith renew
By various maxims, forms and rules
By what amazing ways
By whatever name we call you
By whom shall Jacob now arise
By willful sin the man who wrongs
Father God in heaven, precious Lamb of God
We adore you, O Jesus Christ
By your hand you feed your people
Sing the joyful Easter cry
By your name, O God, now save me
By your name, O God, now save me
At your hands, Lord, we are fed
By Your shaping
By Your side, I would stay
I know my robe's gonna fit me well
I'm but a stranger in this sinful land
Show us, Lord, your love
The sons of Adam in the days of old
Jesus saves me, keeps me each day
Call Jehovah thy salvation
You're calling us
Call them in! the poor, the wretched
Hark! the Master still is calling
In the dawn of life's bright morning when the heart is glad and light
We are imperfect. God is FLAWLESS.
The winds are driving o'er the sea
Called as partners in Christ's service
Called by Christ to be disciples
Called by Christ to love each other
Precious these waters, endless seas (PrÃ©cieuses song les eaux)
Called by the Word, and, with baptism's grace long anointed
Called to a battle
In the foreign heathen country, where the people know not God
[Called to God's Vocation]
Called to labor in God's vineyard
[Called to Live Justly]
Called to the Kingdom for a time like this
Called to work with my Savior, commissioned
Called together and united by the Spirit
He laid him down upon the breast of God
Calling, calling, Jesus is calling
I have watched the sheep astray
Lo! the Shepherd's calling
I hear a voice in rosy morning's glow
When to my spirit there comes a sweet strain
Shout it up the chimney, Call it to the sky
Don't you hear the tender voice of Jesus now
In the sigh of the breeze I can hear
Sinner, won't you listen to the voice of Jesus
Calm me, Lord, as you calmed the storm
Calm me, my God, and keep me calm
Calm me, O God, and keep me calm
Calm on the list'ning ear of night
Calm to the waves
Everytime I think about Jesus
On Calvary's brow my Saviour died
I often think about that awful day
I can see the Savior walking
Far dearer than all that the world can impart 
Give me Calvary love, dear Lord
Calvary, so dear, so sweet, so precious
I carried a burden, a staggering weight
Have you heard of Calvary's fountain
Falling on my knees I worship
O walk together, children
Can a little child like me
Can a nation be changed?
Jesus, the Savior, came down from above (Bacon)
Can I bid thee, lovely stranger
Amid the toil and cares of life
Jesus needs some one to sing of his love
When little children do the wrong
Can such poor feeble worms as we
There's a vacant place to be fill'd once more
Can we by searching find out God
Can you be trusted to shine?
Can you count the stars of evening
Can you see the living Christ
Can you see what we have made
I am bound for Canaan Land
My heart is filled with singing, Iâ€™m happy all the time
My paddle's keen and bright
Hallelujah, Jesus is born
Lightning flashes, thunders roll
Cantai ao Senhor um cÃ¢ntico novo (Rejoice in the Lord and sing God a new song)
O sing ye now unto the Lord
Sing ye with praise unto the Lord
Sing ye with praise unto the Lord
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
Your face, Lord, do I seek
Glory be to God on high
God's glory will be our light
You are the light of the world
This is my commandment
And two shall become one in love
The glory of the Lord shall be revealed
My soul proclaims the Lord my God
What marvels my Lord has done for me
For all of the words that you say are right
Be exalted, Lord, in your strength
Ask and it will be given you
In my distress I cry to the Lord
The righteous live forever
With my song I give thanks and praise
Lord, every nation on earth shall adore you
Make joyful noise, lift up your voice
Salvation and glory and power belong to our God
Praise for the sun, the bringer of day
My soul cries out with a joyful shout
God grant to us your wisdom
[Canticle of Zechariah]
Captain of my salvation, hear!
Captain of thine enlisted host
Captain, we look to Thee
Captains of the saintly band

Dance, O Christ, the dance of birth
I sought him dressed in finest clothes
Carol our Christmas, an upside-down Christmas
Carol sweetly carol, A Savior born today
Caroling, caroling, all throâ€™ the night
Some day the trumpet sound will call for you and me
Carry the light to the lost out on sin's mountain
Carry the sunlight wherever you go
Carry the sunlight wherever you go, Give out the Christ love
The world is full of sin and pain
Do you weary grow on your toilsome road
Is your heart burdened with sorrow and fear
Cast down, O God, the idols
Cast in the net and gather them in
Cast me not in wrath away
Our Master has a worthy place
Cast out, O Christ, cast far away
[Cast the Net Into the Water]
Cast thy burden on the Lord
Cast thy burdens on the Lord
Cast thy burden upon the Lord
Cast your burden on the Lord
Cast your care on Jesus, trust him now
Cast your cares upon the Savior who will bear your heavy load
THERE is strength in knowing Jesus
Dear Lord, because thou knowest
How sweet, my Savior, to repose
Cast thou thy care upon the Lord
Blessed children, saints, elect of God

The way is dark my Father, I've wandered far from Thee
Out in the desert, Lord, I have wandered
Coming home, coming home
I am on the way to the realms of day
I was sad, despairing, going on, not caring
Tho' on the sea of life my little bark is toss'd
I climbed up the mountain and looked o'er the Jordan wide
Savior to Thee I come, burdened with sin
Launch the ship of prohibition
Coming soon, yes, He's coming soon
Coming suddenly! Coming soon!
Coming this way, yes, coming this way
When at thy footstool, Lord, I bend
Jesus is coming again, by and by

Commit thou all that grieves thee
Commit thy soul to Me, the Faithful One
Commit thy way, and day by day
Commit thy ways and goings

Lord, have mercy, mercy
Amen. Amen. Amen. Hosanna in the highest!

No longer strangers to each other
Compassed about with songs, my soul was still

In Jesus Christ I am complete
O the blood of Christ I see
While in this sinful world of woe
Complete in thee, no work of mine

I lay in Zion, for a foundation, a Stone
Earth's crammed with heaven
[Could Earth Not Find a Fairer Place]
Could I command with voice or pen
Could I of all perfection boast
Could we with ink the ocean fill
While Jesus prayed in the garden
I should like to speak to you
Do you for the vict'ry long
Count it joy, and never be discouraged
When you count the ones who love the Lord
The Lord has need of workers to till His field today
Count thy blessings, O my brother
Count your blessings ev'ry day
I had wander'd far away In the land of mighty foes
Why speak of the price we must pay
I am counting ev'rything but loss
My heart with sin is broken
As I look out my window tonight
When I would count my blessings
Courage! Brother, stand!
Courage, brother! Do not stumble
Courage, Christian, trust your Savior
Courage, my sorely-tempted heart!

Dearest Jesus, draw Thou near me
Dearest Jesus though unseen
Dearest Jesus, we are here, To be in thy word instructed
Coming when the day is bright
My thoughts, that often mount the skies
In a world of sin and sorrow
Oft have I said, with inward sighs
To break the chains of sin and death
Hark, how time's wide sounding bell
Death calls our friends, our neighbors, hence
Death in all this world prevaileth
Death is but a friendly stranger
Death is only our translation to the land where joys abide
To thy regions, World-eternal
Death, with his dread commission sealed
Vain man thy fond pursuits forbear
O sinner, sinner, you better pray
A prophetess of God
Deceit and falsehood I abhor
O wanderer come, this hour decide thy path thy heart will choose
Some go away from the house tonight
Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness
Deck thyself with joy and gladness
Declare abroad the heavens do
Declare me innocent, O LORD
Declare, O heavens, the Lord of space;
Deep and precious
Deep and wide, deep and wide
Deep are the wounds which sin has made
Deep be thy sleep! Rest thee within thy grave
Deep beneath dark waters
O my soul; bless the Lord
Deep in my heart I have a wonderful joy
I have a wonderful feeling, In this new heart of mine
Deep in our hearts there is a common vision
Deep in the darkness a starlight is gleaming
Deep in the love of Jesus, I've found a place of prayer
Deep in the shadows of the past
Oh, don't you want to go
Deep were His wounds, and red
Deep within my heart I know Jesus loves me
Deepen the wound thy hands have made
Into the heart of Jesus
Like a mighty river, flowing full and free
Jesus, my Redeemer is so precious to me
Your mercy, Lord, stretches through the heavens.
Deeper than the sin stains
In the blood from the cross
Are you saved from sin today?
Defend me, LORD, from those who charge me
[Defenseless Now He Hangs]
Deign this union to approve
How dear to me, o Lord of hosts
We'll present our bodies a living sacrifice
Delight yourself in the Lord
Delight yourselves in the Lord

Deliver me, O God, To help me, Lord, make haste
Deliver me, O Lord my God
Now may we come to Jesus, our Savior

To thee, O God of truth and love
Delivered from pain
On the golden streets of heaven all men hope to walk some day
Let the love in your heart shine wherever you go
Depth of mercy! Can there be
Descend, O flame of sacred fire
Descend, O Holy Spirit
Descend, O Holy Spirit, thou

Deserters, to the Camp return
Designer, Creator, most provident God

Alas! my heart where is thy absent God
Hear, gracious God, my humble moan
Vexatious world, thy flatt'ring snares
Come let me love; or is my mind 
Jesus, my Lord, in thy dear name unite
The loving kindness of the Lord, delightful theme
Despair not, O heart, in thy sorrow
Lord, who shall drive my trembling soul

The Lord is our defence and aid
Do not, O God, refrain thy tongue
O Lord thou dost revenge all wrong
O God the Gentiles do invade
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause Against a godless race
O Lord, my God, my joyful heart
Did anybody tell me when the Lord saved me?
Did Christ descend from majesty
Did Christ o'er sinner's weep?
I know the Savior died upon the cross
Did our Immanuel die for us
Did a great storm rage around you
O brother, have you been saved from sin
Did you ever stop to think how it will be
Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Well it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
He deliver'd Daniel from the lion's den
Didst Thou, dear Jesus, pray for me
The day of wrath, that awful day, Shall all the world in ashes lay
When Abraham's servant to procure
Diffuse thy beams and teach my heart
Dig deep, O Lord, dig deep into my soul
Are you building today for eternity
Ding dong! Merrily on high
Dios Padre, Dios Hijo, Dios Santo EspÃ­ritu
My garments were all stained with the lucre of sin
Disassemble ev'ry gun and disassemble ev'ry fear
Disciples gathered gladly
Disciples of all nations
Disciples of Christ, Ye friends of the Lamb
Lord, you bring Good News to the poor
I can love my neighbor just as Jesus said
Dismiss me not thy service, Lord
Dismiss us from the house of prayer
Dismiss us, Lord, with blessing, we pray
Dismiss us with thy blessing, Lord
The Lord be with you
May the Lord bless us, protect us from evil
Go in the peace of Christ
Go in the peace of Christ
May it be your light in darkness
Let us go forth in the name of Christ
In vain Apollo's silver tongue
Now, Lord, thy blessing add
Disposer Supreme, and Judge of the earth

As it fell out upon one day
Holy Father, keep those you have given me true to your Name
The Lord forgets his wonted grace
How blest the minds which daily rise
Now Israel may say, and that in truth

We sing to thee, whose wisdom formed
I said I will look to my waies
I wish I was in de land ob cotton
I have read about the beauties of the South Seas
When we think we've done our best, stood the hardest test
Do good to me and I will live
The memories we shared could last a man a lifetime
Whatsoever ye do in word or in deed
Seems your task a heavy load?
By the lip, the leaf, the pen
Would you give your heart to Jesus
Do, Lord, do, Lord, do, Lord, remember me
[Do Not Be Afraid]

Do not be worried and upset
Do not despair, O little flock
Look to God when you are sure
When the morning dawns in beauty
Do not fret on account of the wicked
Do not I love thee, O my Lord?
In God's house there are many places
Jesus died to redeem your soul from death and sin
Do not pass me by, dear Savior
Do not retreat into your private world
"Do not turn away the children
Do not worry for your life
The Lord as he sat at the table,
[Do This In Remembrance of Me]
Our Lord and His disciples
Do thou, just God, a just man's pray'r attend
Do thou, O God, in mercy help
[Do to Others]
Do what you can!
Do what you know is right
Do not stand and wait with folded hands
Do ye, O men, speak righteousness
Do ye speak Righteousness, indeed
When the dreary day is over
Do you ever wish you could fly like a bird
Do you feel your need of cleansing
Do you have any rivers to cross
Do you hear a song resounding thro' the strife
Do you hear the children crying
O do you hear the Savior calling
Do you hear the voice of Jesus
Do you walk with the Lord in the light of His word
Are you trusting Christ, have you turned from sin
Do you know my Savior as I know him?
Do you know the love surpassing?
Do you know Jesus, my Savior and Friend?
Do you know Jesus, the Friend of the friendless
Do you know Jesus, has your soul been redeemed from sin?
Like a strange bird who at the window knocks
Do you know that Christ will come again some day
Do you know that you've been born again
Do you know the friend of sinners?
Do you know the song that the angels sang
Do you know who made the night
Do you need a friend to keep you till the end?

Do you wonder that I love Him?
Thereâ€™s a story you have heard a thousand times
Do you wonder why I love Him
Do you wonder why we're glad?
Do young people love the Lord today

Do your best, and be not troubled
If you do your best each moment as you pass along life's way

Does it pay to follow Jesus

Brothers, don't stay away
Brother, don't stay away
Don't stay in the valley

When the God of Israel told Jonah
Don't turn him away
O soul, why stay away from Jesus
Don't! Don't you get weary
When the saints reach home some morning
I am on my way

Doubt sees the obstacles
Doubt Him not, although He leadeth
Down at the cross where the Savior died, Low at the foot of the Crucified
I am living, daily living, 'neath the shelter of his grace
Down by the Jordan, a prophet named John was baptizing
Goin' to lay down my sword and shield
Down by the station
Down came the rain in a terrible flood
Down deep in my soul a wonderful song
Down from Heavâ€™n winging
Down from his glory, Ever living story
[Down from the Height ]
He gives me joy, joy, joy, joy, down in my heart
As I walked along on life's road one day
Lord, from the depth of Thy love within
Down in the depths He found me
Down in the dumps I'll never go
Down in the valley I meet with my Saviour
For many years I traveled and thru the world did roam
I have wandered away from the gracious Lord
Down over the mountain the wind's blowing mild
Down the mountain the river flows
Many years I've wandered here in this sinful land
Down the valley of the shadow alone I must go
Down to earth, as a dove
As I went down to the river to pray
Down to the sacred wave
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
The God of mercy be adored
Ye angels round the throne
Now to the great and sacred Three
To God the Father's throne

In the depths of my soul's greatest longing
I have known the love of the Lord above

Draw Thou my soul, O Christ
Draw us in the Spirit's tether
Draw us to Thee
Draw us to Thee, in mind and heart
Draw us to Thee, Lord Jesus
Drawing near and list'ning 
In my heart there rings a melody of love
Drawn to the cross which thou hast blest
People who walk in darkness have sought
O my God, when I consider all
Dread Framer of the earth and sky
Dread Jehovah! God of nations!
Dread Sinai roars, the man be curst
Dreadful, pride chastising word
Dream a dream, a hopeful dream
I dream of a Heavenly City
Back in those days of childhood
Over the rainbow up in the blue
I've been dreaming of Heaven dear Mother
When the golden sun is shining out beyond the western hills
Dreidel, spin, dance and turn!
Dressed uniform the soldier's wear
Many precious souls are drifting
Like a ship you're drifting, brother
From God and His precepts
Many are drifting from God and from right
Drifting away from Christ in thy youth
Drifting away from the Savior, Casting reproach on the Lord
We are drifting 'tward eternity
Keep the cables firm my brother
Living water pure and free
Drink and thirst no more
From out of love's mountain there's flowing a fountain
Tho' the clouds may oft hover o'er us
Is there a beautiful thought in your heart
[Driven By a Demon]
Drop, drop, slow tears
Du unbekanntes Land, und ihr
Due praises to the incarnate Love
During the night the lowly shepherds
Dust and ashes touch our face
Dust and ashes, sin and guilt
Remember that you are dust
Dust to dust, the mortal dies
Love of God, so great and holy
Dwell in me, O blessed Spirit
If you want happiness each day as you go on this pilgrim way
[Dwell in the House]
Behold how good and pleasant it is
Blessed Jesus! how He saves me!
I rejoice that I cannot but love Him
I fall on my knees to the Father of Jesus
Brother, hear the cry from the dark domain
Dying, You destroyed our death
Children of Hawaii, Come gather round
Each blade of grass, ev'ry wing that soars
Tho' trouble often waits beside my path of care
Each day a little nearer
EACH day is a gift supernal
Each day I find Him more and more to be what He promised to be
Each good and perfect gift
Each little raindrop dropping in mud
Each morning brings us fresh outpoured
We're building, we're building the temple of God on earth
Many may strive in an earthly race
Each one can reach one
[Each One Should Use]
Each passing moment claiming
The burden of evil gone, with Jesus I'm going on

Early ere the dawn of the morning
In the morning I expected
Early in the morning I will seek your face
Early on a Sunday, women went to weep
Now that my journey's just begun

Easter glory fills the sky, alleluia
The blessed Easter comes again
At break of day three women came
Easter is here, let us rejoice
Long ago at early dawn
He is risen! He is risen indeed!
In grief's passion, deep and holy
In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn
From the sea the mist floats slowly
Easter people, raise your voices
Go in the peace of Christ, alleluia
Hear the bells ringing they're singing
Happy little children
Sweet Easter morn that saw the Lord arise
Jesus is not in the tomb
Eat this bread, drink this cup
Christ is the bread of life
This is His body given for you
Asking for a cup of water
I will bless the Lord at all times
Wilt thou, sinner, be converted?

Behold and have regard
O how happy a thing it is
In life's gay morn, when sprightly youth
While others crowd the house of mirth
As long as life its term extends
In my heart the bells are ringing, I rejoice the whole day long
Echoes from the past, how pleasant to live them o'er again
Listen to the voices sweetly calling
Echoes of glory are ringing

God Himself will give a sign
What means this sound of hurrying feet
Come, come let us adore him

But begun will be the singing

Ev'ry day my heart shall praise Him
Ev'ry day and ev'ry hour
Ev'ry day I love Him more and more
Ev'ry day is a victory
My Savior's praises I will sing
Every day is sweeter when I walk with Him
Ev'ry day He grows a little dearer
Every eye shall see
Ever heart its tribute pays
Every hour for Jesus, shall our motto be,
Every little trouble, every little care
Every minute of every day
Every moment, every hour each day
Only to be what He wants me to be
Every morning mercies new
Ev'ry move I make, I make in you
Every song I sing points yonder
While counting my blessings over one day
Ev'ry space for ev'ry face
Every step, my Savior, lead Thou me
Ev'ry step of the way, my Lord
On my beautiful path falls a golden light
Every step with Jesus thus we love to go
Upon the mountain, when my Lord spoke
Chilly waters dark and cold
A voice cries out in the wilderness
Ev'ry year the Christ child
Ev'rybody has their issues that occupy their mind
Ev'rybody ought to know the wondrous love of Jesus
Everybody should know
In that coming great reunion over on the other shore
What to say Lord
Come, O Spirit of Jesus
Ev'ryone must make a living
Everyone should be quick to listen--hear now and heed--
Everyone's rejoicing
We have cleared off the table
Everything that has voice
When we shall reach that happy place
[Everything You Are, You Give Us]
Ev'rything's changing, and we are changing too
Everywhere I go, the Lord is near me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
Evil I then must be
There's a song of praise that I sing
Ev'ry day is a day of thanksgiving
When the world was condemned by its awful transgression
When I am lone and sad and skies are dark and drear
As we travel t'ward the city just beyond the border line
Ev'rything that has breath

Exalt the LORD, his praise proclaim
Exalt the Lord our God
Exalt the Lord our God, for he is holy
Thee will I laud my God and King
Except the Lord conduct the plan
Except the Lord do build the House
Except the Lord, that he for us had been
We'll all rise up together
I'll spend my few remaining days
I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant
The Lord is my strength, my protection and my shield
I sing to God, triumphant is he
O Lord, to us Thy mercy show
I waited long and sought the Lord

No words can declare
Glory to God in the highest
Rejoice, heavenly powers!
Extol the love of Christ, ye saints

Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard
Eye hath not seen Thy glory: Thou alone
Better mind, my sister, how you walk on de cross
Some go to church just to sing and shout
Face to face with Christ my Savior
What if my Lord should call for me tonight
Facing a task unfinished
I'm walking with Christ, the Friend that I love
Fades the glory of the west--
Fain would I, Lord, the word receive
Faint falls the gentle voice of prayer
Faint with the heat and the length of the road
Faint, yet pursuing, we press our way
Fair as a beauteous tender flower
Fair beyond telling 
O land of all earth's lands, the best
Fair shines the morning star
Fair waved the golden corn
Fair wind and the sky is clear
Fairest Lord Jesus
Fairest Lord Jesus, Lord of all creation
Fairest of all the lights above
Fairy vessels in the sky
Often the "Faith of our fathers" is tried
Faith adds new charms to earthly bliss
Lord while my thoughts with wonder trace
Faith and truth and life bestowing
Faith begins by letting go
Do you see in the distance yonder
Faith comes by hearing
When compassed with clouds of distress
Faith for thy service, my Father, I ask -
Faith, Hope, and Charity
Come, let us love, for love is of God
If I speak with the voice of angels but do not love
Faith is a living powr from heav'n
[Faith Is Assurance, Hope of Things Unseen]
Faith is being open
Once I was tossed by wild waves of doubt
Faith is patience in the night
Faith is the victory
Living for Jesus in the light of true and love
Faith means we're sure of what we hope to get
Faith of our brothers, suffering sore
Faith of our fathers! living still
Faith of our fathers, taught of old
Faith of our mothers, living still
Who keepeth not God's word, yet saith
Hail, Alpha and Omega, hail!
Faith, while trees are still in blossom
Do you sigh for victory?
Faith will not grow from words alone
Faithful Christians, one and all
Who shall dare to sing the praises
Where ever there is charity
Wherever there is charity, selfless, giving care
Faithful forever
Faithful God, faithful God
Faithful God, I lay before thee
True and faithful we would be along the way of life
In the service of the Lord, trusting only in His Word
Come and join the reapers
I am looking to Jesus, giving all in the race
Faithful Shepherd, feed me
Faithful soul, behold your King
I'll try to prove faithful, dear Savior
Faithful vigil ended
All ye that pass by
Fall down ye nations, and adore
O Thou Potter of my soul
A warfare is raging
Duty is calling her soldiers today
Hungry, I come to you
When I tread this vale of shadows
Far above all other loves
Far and near, hear the call
Lord, a little band, and lowly
I've turned my back upon the world
Many dear ones are departed
Far beyond our minds' grasp and our tongues' declaring
Far beyond our understanding
Far, far beyond the starry sky
Far from home we run, rebellious
Far from my heavenly home
Far from our mortal cares retreating
Far from the Lord, I wandered long Until the Gentle Shepherd came
[Far from the Markets of Rich Meat and Wine]
Far from Thy heavenly care
[Far Greater Than Great]
Far let me flee from worldly sin
[Far More Than Passion's Passing Flame]
Far off I see the goal
Far round the world Thy children sing their song
Fare well. We come to send you on the way
How like a dream the hour that's past
Farewell, dear brothers, fare you well
The parting hour must surely come
Farewell, farewell, a sad, a long farewell
Farewell, farewell, farewell, my friends, I must be gone
Farewell, faithful friends, we must now bid adieu
Farewell I gladly bid Thee

Give thanks to the Lord, for God is good
Come, let us sing in joyful song
As through this life I journey along
The things of earth soon pass away

God's love made visible! Incomprehensible
My God above with smiles of love
Did Christ the great Messiah come
Words of love from above Jesus has brought to the world
God's not dead; (No!) he is alive
So long have God's servants been calling
God's own child, I gladly say it
God's Paschal Lamb is sacrificed for us
Sometimes the path is hidden
If kneeling at the gate of prayer
God spoke to Israel
God's perfect law converts the soul, Reclaims from false desires

My Father's ways are always right
The Christian's life is born
God's way is best; if human wisdom
God's way is best for me I know
I know not what is best for me
'Tis a precious old treasure I read ev'ry day
My soul is at peace as onward I trod
The Bible was given
God's word alive and active
My light in the darkness, my star in the night
God's Word is our great heritage
For feelings come and feelings go
[God's Word throughout the Ages]
God, who made the world of beauty
Goin' home, goin' home
If you wanna know where I'm going
Going along, singing a song
I'm going down to the river of Jordan
I was a poor lost sinner without a hand to guide
Behold ahead I hear sweet singing
Some day I'm leaving this old world of sin
I have no abiding city but I seek a place above
As I press the way along I shall sing a joyful song
I never had a friend on earth like mother
What a happy time 'twill be, yonder in the sky
Do you feel the love of Jesus?
We are traveling on lifeâ€™s journey
I am in the fight for Jesus, and I'm here to stay
I'm a pilgrim here below but I soon shall leave I know
I am going home to heaven in the blessed old gospel way
I've a home in yonder city, far above
As I travel along to glory
The Lord has been so good to me, He saved and set my spirit free
Soon will I journey to heaven's shore
Oft my path is dark and dreary and the clouds bedim the way
We are going onward to a City
Going to glory telling the story
I'm going homeward with the King divine
In the path of beauty I am traveling now
I've got a robe, you've got a robe
I am going home to that eternal City, built for us in heav'n above
When we hear the trumpet sounding in the sky
Following the King before us
With singing heart and shining soul
"Going up, going up, going up, going up"
Homeward I'm going, singing a song
When I walked in sin I claimed no kin with the Saviour on the throne
I was lost, away from my Lord
Mine eyes are fixed on the Heav'nly prize
We are going up to Bethel, we will meet our Savior there
Going with Jesus the narrow way
A legend says to many men
When the way is lonely dark and drear
Golden harps are sounding
There is golden Lovelight now shining over life's way
Let us do unto others
Goliath was big and Goliath was strong
Gone are the shades of night
Gone from our home forever
From our care our Heav'nly Father
Gone is my burden, he rolled it away
Gone to rest, my dear companion
Jesus went away to build a beautiful home
Are you weary, heavy laden?
Oh, once I had a loving mother
When the trump shall sound on that great morning, what a happy jubilee
On that great morning when I hear the trumpet sound
When Christ my Lord shall call for me to cross the deep and mystic sea
Gonna see Jesus some glad tomorrow
I'm a pilgrim in this land
I am heading for the land of glory and I know I'll soon be there
While I tread this sinful path below
Once I was lost out in the darkness of the night
Goodbye, pastor, goodbye
Goodbye, we say with swelling heart
Good christian friends, rejoice
Good Christians all, rejoice and sing
Good day and welcome, dear Christmas tree
Some day I'll go to glory where sinners never roam
My mother trod the way to God
Christ crucified
Good God, I am not insolent and high
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
Good it is to keep the fast
[Good Master, We Are Debtors]

Halle, halle, hallelujah
Praise God in this holy place
What a friend we have in Jesus
Hallelu the LORD our God!
[Hallelujah]
Hallelujah, hallelujah Sing ye servants of the Lord
What can separate my soul 
O, I've been to the sea, and I've done been tried
Blood bought saints sing hallelujahs
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, amen! In all I say and I do
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
See the splendor of the morning
On some cloudless morning we shall hear the trumpet sound
I saw a poor wayfaring pilgrim one day
I have found a friend on whom I can depend
Hallelujah for the blood, for the sin-cleansing fountain
I was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
Hallelujah for the Lamb of God!
I am satisfied with Jesus, His salvation is complete
Blessed is the peace divine within my soul
The cross, it standeth fast
By your word you spoke light from darkness
As our fathers shouted, Hallelujah! Glory!
I love to think of Christ, my King
Hallelujah, Hallelujah; all you peoples praise proclaim
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Cleansed in our Savior's precious blood
The Lord, our God, is King; Let earth rejoice (Wesley)
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Sing his praise loud and clear
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
To Him who for our sins was slain
Joy is springing up within me
Easter lilies have their beauty
Hallelujah! heart and voice
Oh! the happy day, the day when Christ shall come again
Since the Savior found me, I'm so glad and free
When the earth shall reel and tremble and the mountains move apace
On the resurrection morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
Joy-bells are ringing in my happy soul today
What hope we have
He was dead in the grave
We are coming with our praises to our Lord and King
I want to see little David and his priceless harp of gold
It is well in happy hours to sing a hallelujah song
Hallelujah, my Father
I'm rejoicing today, As I go on my way
Hallelujah! For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns.
We will work till Jesus comes
I once was loaded down with sin, but Jesus came along
Hallelujah, praise Jehovah
Hallelujah, praise Jehovah, O my soul
Hallelujah! Praise the Lamb!
Hallelujah, praise the LORD
Hallelujah, praise the Lord
When the world was steeped in sin, no love-light shining
Hallelujah! Praise the LORD
Hallelujah, Praise ye God!
Hallelujah! Raise, O raise
Hallelujah! Raise, O raise
Hallelujah! sing to the Lord songs of praise
[Hallelujah Song]
We praise thee, O God!
My God, I have found the thrice blessed ground
We praise thee, O God! For the days of our youth
All the way my Lord is leading me
Hallelujah, 'tis done, I believe on the Son
Jesus hung on the cruel tree
In the resurrection morning, When the trump of God shall sound
Christ the Lord to us said
There is a happy land to which some day, we're going
Jesus never will forsake us as we travel here below
Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging
Ngarikudzwe zuva  (Lift up your voice, sing for joy)
Hallelujah, let praises ring
Come, Lord, Thyself with Thine abounding grace
Hallow we with praise the day
Hallow'd be this humble spot
Hallowed be the name of Jesus
You are love, You are life
Hallowed church bell, not for earthly centers
Ham and eggs, ham and eggs
Though rough may be the journey
Once from my poor sin-sick soul Christ did every burden roll
I ain't been to heav'n but I've been told
[Hands Are Holding Rust]
Safely lead the young ones
Hanging there for me
No more lonely days of pain and misery
The trumpet of God Is sounding abroad
I'm inright, outright, upright, downright happy all the time
I'm up, right in, right out, right down, right happy all the time
I am rejoicing in His love, since I've found the friend above
Of the great love that saved my soul, ever I'm singing
Jesus my Savior calms my fear, happy am I that He is near
Happy are they, they that love God
Happy are they who trust in the Lord
Happy are they who hope
Happy are they who walk in God's wise ways
[Happy Are Those]
[Happy Are Those, Beyond All Measure Indeed]
Happy are those who do what the Lord commands
[Happy Are Those Who Tend the Poor and Weak]
[Happy Are Those Whose Offence is Forgiven]
We are on the way to the home in glory, singing out the song with a grand old story
Happy be devoted teachers
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
We are happy children
Happy day, happy day, gladly we greet thee
The greatest day in history
Happy days, happy days

As we journey onward to those mansions up in glory
Happy faces, see them come
Happy forever happy I
Just beyond the sunset glowing, is a land of wondrous hue
Happy in my Savior, blest from day to day
Working for the Master in His harvest field
Happy hearts children bring
Won't it be grand to dwell with the Saviour up in Heaven some day
Tho' the dark shadows around me may low'r
I was lost, despairing, no one for me caring
I am happy in my Savior's keeping
Happy in the service of my King
I'm happy in Jesus each hour of the day
Happy am I in Jesus my Savior

Oh! happy is the man who believeth in Christ the blessed Son
Happy is the name of the Lord
Happy is the nation whose God is Lord of all
There's a land of fadeless beauty
Happy Magdalene, to whom
Happy New Year, happy New Year, Sing we our closing chorus
We come with songs to greet you
Happy now, happy now
Happy in the love of my dear Lord
They crucified my blessed Saviour, they nailed Him to the cruel tree
Happy on the pilgrim way
This is the way I long have sought And mourned
I am happy that is why I'm singing
I am in the way, the bright and shining way
Happy on the way to glory
Happy on a highway to a better land
Happy our home when God is there
Jesus has promised me, if I will faithful be
We are happy singers on the glory road
Happy souls that Christ obey
We are happy sunbeams
Happy the child, who early makes
Happy the child whose youngest years
Happy the home that welcomes you, Lord Jesus
Happy the home when God is there
Happy the home when God is there

Happy the man whose heart can rest
Happy the Man, whose tender Care
Happy the people the Lord has chosen to be his own
Happy the poor in spirit
Happy, thrice happy they, who hear
Happy town of Salem
A little brown bird, with eyes so bright
HAPPY we who trust in Jesus
I'm happy ev'ry day, walking the narrow way
On that holy night when the angels bright
There is a light that shines afar
Preserve me, O God, my Savior
Hard heart of mine!
The foxes, they have holes in the ground
Hark! a glad exulting throng
Hark! A thrilling voice is sounding
Hark! a voice is loudly ringing
Hark! a voice! it cries from heaven
Hark! a voice saith, All are mortal
Hark! don't you hear the turtle dove
Hark for the great Creator speaks

Hark! hark! glad tidings charm our ears
Hark! hark! hark! what doleful sounds I hear
Children of Jerusalem
Hark, hark, my soul! the Savior's voice is calling
Hark! hark! the song from youthful voices breaking
Hark! Hear the voice that cries in the desert

Hark, how the adoring hosts above

Hark! my soul, it is the Lord
Children! children! Come with joyous singing
Hark! ten thousand harps and voices

Thou visitest the earth in love
Summer time is swiftly, swiftly passing by
Harvest-tide has come again
Harvesting hunger is my fate
O believer in Jesus, O child of God
Has the life that you have lived
Hast thou heard of that wonderful Jesus
Hast thou ever seen the Lord
Hast to the plough thou put thy hand
Hasta tu altar venimos hoy, SeÃ±or (Unto your table, Lord, we come today)
Jesus calls for workers true
Haste from afar
Haste, O Lord, my spirit faints
Haste, traveller, haste, the night comes on
Hasten, Lord, that morn of glory
Hasten, Lord, the glorious time
I am waiting for the morning, Of the day that brings release
Hasten the time appointed
Sure the night of death draws near
Let us hasten to the rescue
Hasten, ye faithful, joyful, glad, and holy
Brother if your burdens are too heavy
I heard about a blessed friend
O have a little talk with Jesus
O my Savior, I am weary
Be not discouraged when dark your way
Have faith in God; what can there be
Have faith in God, believe in [on] Jesus
Have faith in God
Have faith in God
Have faith in God, my heart;
Have faith in God, the Master said
Have faith in God, my brother, and fight the hosts of sin
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus
Have I given Jesus my heart?
Have mercy, God, upon my life
Have mercy in your goodness, Lord
Where are those who thirst for justice?
[Have Mercy, Lord, Have Mercy]
Have mercy, Lord, mercy I crave
Have mercy, Lord, on me, For thou my Judge shalt be
Have mercy, Lord, Thy wrath remove
[Have Mercy, Lord, We Cry]
My offenses truly I know them
Have mercy of us, living Lord
O great Redeemer, King of all creation
Have mercy on us, Lord, for we have sinned
O God, in your kindness, have mercy on me
Have mercy upon me, O God
Have mercy upon me, O God
Have no fear, little flock
Have pity, Lord, for Thou art great
Have pity upon me, O God
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Have we any gift worth giving
See the glory of God light up the sky
Have we not known? Have we not heard
Have ye been to Nazareth
Have you any room for Jesus
There are many urgent voices
Oh, my brother, are you saved from a life by sin depraved?
Have you been faithful to Jesus, my friend?
Have you been given riches from heaven
On the cross uplifted high
There's a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord
Have you counted the cost of the Savior's love
As you seek for the pleasures that soon pass away
Have you ever heard the story
Have you felt the touch of the nail-pierced hand
Have you found the Savior precious, More than all on earth beside
Have you got an appetite?
Have you heard about the stone
Have you heard God's voice; has your heart been stirred
[Have You Heard the Good News]
There is a way
Have you heard the good news of God's wonderful grace?
Have you heard? Oh, have you heard the news?
Have you heard the Savior knocking at your sin-filled heart
Have you made your reservation for a home on high
Have you not known? Have you not heard?
Have you not known, have you not heard
Do you live a life that's true for the One who died for you?
My Savior made a rainbow in the cloud
Have you shared the good news to-day, my Friend
Hallelujah! Thank the Lord for sun, sand, and sea
Sinner, have you thought of heaven
Have you told Jesus the burdens you bear
Somebody told the sweet story to you
Have you tried Jesus in all your searching?
Have you wandered away where you never should go?
Soldier of Christ, be steadfast
O little baby
Hawaiian rainbow, white clouds roll by
In a cold new tomb they laid my Lord away
He arose, my Savior, he arose, my Savior,
O heart, be glad and gay
Shepherds were keeping their nightly watch
He became poor that we may be rich
O what love my blessed Savior showed
My precious Savior suffered pain and agony
Oh, awful load for that bow'd Head
Our Savior died upon the cross
The human race was steeped in disgrace
My Savior bottles up my tears
[He Bought the Whole Field]
He brought me out of darkness into light
He brought me out of the darkness into the light
He brought me to His banqueting table
When Jesus came down from His glory and crown
He is calling thee, my brother, He is calling thee today
How precious the thought that the God of all power
Down by the sea of Galilee
He came because the Father willed
[He Came Down]
He came in weakness, comes in power
WHEN wondrous words my Lord would say
He Came Singing Love
We wonder why Christ came into the world
He came to save sinners, the dear Son of God
He will break every fetter
So heavy was sin's awful weight
He cannot forget me
He cares for you, He cares for you
He cares for me, O blessed thought
He careth for me, my Father cares
O why am I restless and fretting
He careth for me
He careth for thee, whosoever thou art
He careth for you, He careth for you
O why will you carry your burdens so long?
He careth for you
He carried my sins far away
I'm happy, happy, Glory to His name
Amid the changing scenes below
A wonderful change has come into the world
To the fountain of Jesus' blood
He climbed the mountain; and behold
He climbed the slopes of Olivet
He comes! he comes! the Judge severe
He comes! he comes! the Savior dear
He comes! he comes! to judge the world
When the storm of life is raging wild
He comes, the royal conqueror comes
[He Comes, the Way that All May Tread]
Glory in the highest, glory
He comes to us as one unknown
He comes to us as One Unknown
He Comes to Us This Carpenter
He cometh, Father, as He came of old
There flows from His side
When I was bound by cords of sin
I was lost, couldn't find my way
He died for me on Calvary
Upon the cross of Calvary
Hark, hark, hark!
Our Saviour died on Calvary
Oh, praise the Lord, He hides my past
How wonderful the thought
Jesus my Lord came down from above
On the stormy Galilee
I do not know why it must be
My Savior came down from heav'n above
I am glad to say that I have turned away from sin
He "gave Himself for me"; oh, blessed word!
[He Gave His Life in Selfless Love]
He gave me a song in the darkness of night
He gave me beauty for ashes
In darkness long my soul had wandered, till Jesus came and took me in
When I was blind and could not see
One day the blessed Savior left His home in heaven above
When night her mantle throws around
He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater
Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard
He goes with me upon the stormy ocean
Christ had to go to Calvary
He has been given
He has done great things for me
He has entered! He has entered
God's great power divine now has given us
I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart
If you walk in darkness all alone
When the life flowed from His body
Have you ever heard the story of the Savior
He has showed you, O man what is good
The Lord of love has shown to me
He hath told thee what is good
He healed the darkness of my mind
When I was lost in sin, dark was the night
Oft I'm thinking of the past
I heard the blessed message
I go to my Lord each hour of the day
He holdeth me safe in His arms!
My feet were fast slipping: I'd fallen in sin
I travel onward in the light
While going thru this vale of sorrow
If you would unlock the door of peace
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
I have a Savior who loves me I know
When I think of God in all His pow'r
[He Is Able]
He is able, He is able
"He is able;" Oh, the comfort
He is able, abundantly able to deliver, to deliver
When the prophet Daniel prayed to God on bended knee
In His strength be strong, though the way be long
Jesus the Savior of all mankind
I know that grace divine will keep this soul of mine
In the quietude of home and in the noisy throng
He is arisen! Glorious Word!
He is born, our Lord and Saviour
O sinner, will you listen
The Savior hath said That no tears shall be shed
I know that my Father is caring
The love of my Lord is boundless and free
Jesus is with me each hour of the day
When the Savior had gone into heaven
Jesus came from heaven to die upon the tree
On the resurrection morning We shall hear the clarion warning
He is coming soon
He is coming soon
Is your weary heart o'erburdened
Riches and honor could never save my soul
When I was in trouble, my way was dark as night
He is exalted, the king is exalted on high
Though you wander in the byways
Our brother went to that good place
He Is here, hallelujah!
He is here, He is here
There is naught to fear, when the day is drear
He Is Jehovah, God of creation
He is just the One to meet my ev'ry need
Have you ever heard of Jesus,
Have you ever heard the story Of the Babe of Bethlehem
Christ the Lord is keeping me under His control
He is King, He is King
He built His throne up in the air
I know that my Redeemer lives
He is King of kings, He is Lord of lords
He is Lord, he is Lord
[He Is Lord]
He is mine, He is mine
I have a Friend who keeps me free and glad
Jesus is a friend you ought to know
Jesus, Jesus
Greatest joy it is to know that His blessings round me flow
THERE was a Saviour came seeking his sheep
I have found a precious friend in Jesus
Jesus is a loving Friend
When shadows of gloom overtake me
Jesus found me and unbound me
I am rejoicing, for Jesus is mine
Tho the road ahead may be uncertain
When shadows hover near
Once when I wandered in darkness of night
Once the Savior of men was a stranger to me
O soul, thy way seems hedged about with care
We have a Friend who never fails
Come all ye people of God and rejoice
He is our peace, who has broken down every wall
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord
Though sorrows come my way
He is pleading, gently pleading
Come see the place where Jesus lay, The Lord arose ere dawn of morn
Ring, sweet lily-bells, ring today
Lone in the garden they laid Him
O trumpet sound a vict'ry call
He is risen! glorious message
He is risen! He is risen!
Jesus lives, O day of days
He is risen, He is risen
He is ris'n, our Lord is risen
Do you think of the Lord in the days of His grace?
He is standing with us here in the plain
[He Is the Image]
He is the King of kings
Cry out with joy to the Lord, all you nations!
He is the Lord and He reigns on high
He is the mighty God
I wanna tell you about Jesus
He is the Way
Is your heart sorely grieved, and in sorrow bereaved
There are foes here and there, many trials to bear
On my way, night or day, I am not alone
I am not afraid to go with Christ, my Lord
Christ in mercy came to earth from glory land
I have glory untold in the beautiful fold
He keeps me singing all the way
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
He knelt to wash the feet of friends
I know not, the way is so misty and dark
I know not the field where the master today
O Lord, Thou art my King
O, soul in want and sorrow
When days are long, and nights are drear
When blessings are crowning my days
We cannot understand
He knows, he knows
He knows, He loves, He cares
I love to think my Father knows
We are our heavenly Father's children
There are times when I want to do wrong
This thought is dearer far to me
I have a Maker, He formed my heart
I am treading the road and bearing my load
He knows, yes, he knows
He leadeth me: O blessed thought
He leadeth me for I can feel
With Jesus my Saviour I go hand in hand
God does not always lead me where the spring time zephyrs blow
Jesus walks and talks with me, while leading me on
I know the love and grace of Him whose heart
To Him clinging, tributes bringing
He leads us on by paths we did not know
I wandered in the vales of night
He led them forth to Bethany
In loving kindness Jesus came
I walked upon sin's drifting sand
I'm trusting in Jesus my Savior and friend
I was out on the broad way of sin and despair,
He lifted me up - yes, up
On Calvary my Savior died
Behold our risen Lord today
Awake, awake, O earth! Thy many voices raise
Have you heard this wondrous story Of the victory for God
He lives, the Savior lives
When in the grave the Savior lay
'Twas in the morning's early dawn
[He Lives in Us, the Christ of God]
I'm thinking of a loving friend up in the glory land
He lives, the great Redeemer lives
He ever lives triumphantly
Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise
My Jesus he loved me, I cannot tell why
He loved me first! Ah! that was why
He loved me, I cannot tell why
He loved me so! oh, praise his name!
I am so glad that Jesus came
Sometimes the days seem so dreary
He's the one who loves me in the morning
Many years, my Savior
O way faring one
When I was lost in darkest night
Once I wandered out in sin
He mounts to where the azure shines
"He must die or all will perish"
Do you think that the Lord forgets you
I have a friend of all others the best
My Saviour has promised to guard and to keep
There is one who rules in heaven
They crucified my Lord
He never said a mumbalin' word
No, no, no, He never will forsake me
I am glad that I know Jesus loves me so well
God so loved the world that He gave His own Son
God's cov'nant stands forevermore
The Son of God is at my side
My weary soul in sin was lost
The Savior died for you and me
Once my soul was stained with sin, now His love-light shines within
Across life's sea, thro' calm and storm
Jesus went upon the mountain that He might commune with God
This world is so filled with sorrow and strife
He promised me, though blind and halt and lame
Christ will never fail me, how precious the word
I've found the favor of Christ the Savior
[He Put a New Song]
He put a song, yes a song in my heart
Into my heart there came a wonderful song
When I was a sinner lost in sin, Jesus came along and took me in
The tempest was raging on blue Galilee
Afar I was wand'ring, in sin and despair
Our Hero strong once conquered wrong
The kings of earth may rise and fall, however great they be
He reignsâ€”thâ€™ Almighty reigns supreme
Jesus is my Guide
I was a sinner but now I'm free
When weary am I of the cares of the day
O ye people of creation, lift your eyes, behold a King
When Israel out of bondage came
They crucified my Savior
He rose! O morn of wonder
He rose triumphantly
Our blessed Lord was slain
With the blest assurance of my Saviour dear
When Jesus was leaving, His followers grieving
Down in the valley while on my knees
'Twas Easter Sunday morning
He sat to watch o'er customs paid
Jesus is my loving Savior and He lives within my soul
I have found a balm in sorrow
O Jesus is a satisfying portion
O sing the song of salvation
I earnestly prayed for deliverance from sin
I've been pardoned by the blood of Jesus
He saved others, scorners cried
Sing glory to God in the highest
I was burdened with sin, and with doubtings and fears
I was once far away from the Savior, And his face was not smiling on me
Oh, what a wonderful Savior is Jesus!
He saw me sinking in distress
My soul was filled with grief within
In every time of trouble
He sent His Word, His holy Word
I Once was bound by chains of sin
He plucked me out of the mire and clay
Though the work of life be lowly
He shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Almighty God
He shall cover thee here with his feathers
[He Shall Reign]
He shall reign o'er all the earth
Christ shed His blood to wash away our sin
Let us follow Jesus for He shows to us the way
O burdened soul now in distress
He stands outside the doors we've closed
He stood before the city, and wept at what he saw.
He that believes and is baptized
O promise sweet for every one
Christ gave His life on Calv'ry's tree
He that confides in his Creator
He that does in the secret place
[He That Dwelleth in the Secret Place]
He that goeth forth with weeping
He that has God his guardian made
[He That is in Us]
Rest, weary heart, in sweet content
He that overcomes will stand
He that overcomes through me
He that, the Highest's secret place
He that winneth souls is wise!
Love divine, so great and wondrous
When trials come and foes appear
When I was just a sinner, and lived in guilt and shame
O wondrous Christ, O blessed Lord
He took my sin
I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad.
He took my sins away
Shackled by a heavy burden
Although I was by sin defiled
I'm on my way to realms of light
He walked where I walk
He walks among the golden lamps
He walks before me on life's highway
God has sent the Holy Spirit
When none was found to ransom me
He was not willing that any should perish
He was pierced for our transgressions
He was wounded for our transgressions
All through the day
Rejoice, rejoice for tidings glad are in the very air
He watching over Israel, slumbers not, nor sleeps
When Jesus was treading the pathway of earth
I was lone and sad
I once was troubled in my soul, and walked the downward way
My heart was discouraged despondent and sad
I have a new song deep down in my soul
My pathway no longer is dreary
[He Who Abides In Me]
[He Who Began a Good Work in You] (Boer)
He who began a good work in you
He who bore witness by a good confession
He who by a motherâ€™s love
He who dwells
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
He who formed the highest heaven
He who has helped me hitherto
He who in the fiery furnace
He who is near to me is near to the fire
He Who made the earth His home
He who safely keepeth
He who walked upon the water
He who wants to be born of God
He who would follow Christ in life
He who would lead a happy life
He who would valiant be
He whom shepherds once came praising
I am clinging to Jesus, my wonderful friend
When you need a friend to help you on your pilgrim way
Jesus my Redeemer, Savior, hears me when to Him I pray
The King of heaven left
Nothing can harm me, no foe can alarm me
Whosoever may be before me
I walk today in the Christian way,
If you want to live happy from day unto day
If your way seems distraught and your aims come to naught
Listen to the voice of Jesus saying
We are living in a world of turmoil
Happy are the ones who follow Jesus all along the way
Why art thou fearful, beloved of the Lord
When I fear my faith will fail
"As thy day thy strength shall be"
I have met a most wonderful Redeemer from Glory
When your valley is so very deep
He who hath led will lead
When the way seems dark and dreary
If you have a burden hard to bear, take it to the Lord in humble prayer
In this life of sin and sorrow
My Saviour has a home prepared beyond the skies
With the great Commander homeward going to that world above
To the Lord in prayer we all should go
"Fear not, I am with you forever"
Gracious is the promise of my Lord and King
Trusting in the promise of my blessed Lord
Sweet is the promise of the Saviour divine
He will never let go my hand
I came to Jesus in my sin
Tho' you may walk in grief alone
I'm safe within the upward way
I have a Friend to guide me lest I stray
When my boat I shall anchor over on the golden strand
As I travel on my journey, with my Lord, I know
When on the cross of Calv'ry
In shame o'er my guilt and my sin-stains
Often times in this life we grow discouraged
Do not wait to be a witness
He will send showers of blessing
In that happy home up yonder many loved ones for us look
When sore afflictions crush the soul
Once I was sad, my heart was sore distressed
When worried or troubled or burdened by care
'Twas God's own Son who came to earth
I heard my Saviour calling
He writes the pardon on my heart
One day I heard a voice from Heaven
Head of the church triumphant
Head of the hosts in glory!
Head of Thy Church, her glorious Head
Head of Thy suffering Church below
Though trouble overtakes, my Savior never forsakes
There is a home in the land of tomorrow
Heading now for Heaven, I am going to the home above
Heal me, heal me
Heal me, hands of Jesus
Heal me, O my Saviour, heal
[Heal Our Land]
[Heal Their Land]
Heal us, Emmanuel, hear our prayer
You hold my every moment
Healer of boundless compassion
Healer of my soul
You who know our fears and sadness
Healer of the sick
Healing God, almighty Father
Merciful God and Father
O healing river, send down you waters
Renew my heart, O God
Hear, gracious Sovereign, from thy throne
Hear, heaven and earth, your Godâ€™s appeal
Jesus, Friend of children
Hear Judea's mountains ringing
Hear, Lord, my prayer, to my request
Hear, Lord, the voice of my complaint
O Heavenly Father, hear my supplication
Hear me, O God! when near Thy throne
Hear me, O LORD, and answer me
Hear me, O Lord! in my distress
Like Peter when you said to him
O my Savior, Lord I need Thee
[Hear My Cry]
Hear my cry and supplication
Hear my cry, O God
I will abide in thy dwelling place forever
"Hear my prayer for unity,"
Hear my prayer, O Lord
Hear my prayer, O Lord
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint
O God, my heart is steadfast
Hear, O Lord, my plea for justice
Hear, O LORD, my urgent prayer
Hear, O Lord, our supplication
Hear, O my People, to my Law
May our homes be filled with dancing
Hear our prayer, hear our prayer, Lord, make us whole
Hear our prayer, O Lord
Hear our prayer, O gracious Father
Hear our prayer, O heavenly Father
Hear our prayer, O Lord
Onward, soldiers of Jesus, hear the battle cry
Hear the bugle calling, come without delay (Bitler)
Hear the bugle calling, come without delay (John)
Hear the devas' singing on this morn of grace
Hear the gentle voice of Jesus
Oh, behold the golden fields of ripened grain
Hear the joy-bells ringing, Happy voices singing
Hear the royal proclamation
I am the Way, O hear ye the blessed Savior say
Do you hear the Savior speaking
O dear sinner friend, do not travel on
[Hear the Songs of Thanks We Raise]
[Hear the Sound, My Friend]
Sinner, have you heard the story
Hear the strains of peace and justice bringing hope from far and near
If you are weary and longing for rest
Hear the voice of God, so tender
Hear the wail across the sea
Would you be a valiant soldier
Hear this all people, and give ear
Hear this all People, and give Ear
Hear this, all ye people, hear
Hear this, all you peoples; listen
Hear thy children, gentle Jesus, While we breathe our evening prayer
Hear us, Father, when we pray
Hear us now, our God and Father
Hear us, O God
[Hear Us, O Lord]
Hear us, O Lord, have mercy upon us
Hear us, O people, hear our plea
Hear us, O Shepherd of your chosen race
Hear us, Thou that broodedst
Saved by blood I live to tell
Hear what the voice from heaven declares, To those in Christ who die
There is One speaking â€œas never man spakeâ€
This is my beloved Son
While the Shepherd is calling
Hear ye the call, hear ye the call, sounding
Youthful soldiers strong and brave
Hear your children, O God
Hearken and listen, Zion's lovely daughter
Hearken to the anthem glorious
Heart and heart together bound
Lord, you are my shepherd
Heart of Christ Jesus, love overflowing
Heart of Jesus, holy myst'ry
We come with songs of gladness
Heart to heart in love united
Have you prayers that are yet to be answered
Let hearts and hands be joined in one
Hearts of stone, relent, relent
Over the billows drifting, drifting
Ye souls that trust in Christ, rejoice
Hark! from that glorious world what songs
I now prepare for joys up there
With Christ and all his shining Trains
Heaven and earth, and sea and air
Heaven and earth, and sea and air
Heaven as a tent Thine hand displayed
How fragrant, like sweet heaven, that home where Christ is Lord
I am in the gospel way, climbing higher ev'ry day
O I hear sweet music ringing, sounds like angel voices singing
Once a stranger I wandered in darkness of sin
Heaven fills my soul
Heaven has confirmed the great decree
Earth holds no treasures but perish with using,
Has your heart's deep longing been denied
Heaven is a place of rest from sin
Sometimes I get lonesome and long to go home
On that glad morning afterwhile
Heaven is in my soul today
The welcome news my soul makes glad
Jesus came one day washed my sins away
Here I have a place to rest and tarry till my labor on this earth is over
I was wand'ring as a stranger, in a distant land
Heaven is not far away
Heaven is open wide
Since I have consecrated all to my Lord and Saviour
Heaven is the place for all of God's children when they leave this world below
We read in the Bible of heaven
In Heaven we're told the streets are pure gold
Last night on my pillow, as my heart began to pray
What joy to walk with Jesus
Twilight is falling
Bright angels are coming for me
Heaven touches earth by singing
Heaven waits with eager longing
Heaven was built for all who daily trust in the Lord
I'm thinking today, of my old-fashioned home
Heaven will be a happy place
Standing on the promises of Christ my Saviour
It is time to be thinking of heaven
Angelic throngs unnumbered
Heav'nly angels, listen
What hath the world to equal this
Jesus, Savior, heavenly Bread
For lovely things I hear and see
Heavenly Father, Lord, I need you in my life, in my life
Heavenly Father, God of Love! Send Thy blessing from above
Heavenly Father, hear us, While we bow before thee
Heavenly Father we adore thee at thy feet
Heavenly food for men wayfaring
Heavenly hosts in ceaseless worship
Heavenly message, brought by an angel
Music fills the air
Salvation to our God
Heavenly Shepherd, guide us, feed us
Heavenly Shepherd, thee we pray
I hear holy voices over the sea
Heavenly Spirit, all others transcending
The heavenly sunlight is flooding my soul with
Heavenly things my soul hath seen
Heavenly thoughts create my song
Frequent the day of God returns
I'm going to a celebration, yonder in the sky
Many times I'm lonely here, downhearted too
Ev'ry tho't of golden deed that will help another's need
In youth's glad hour when all is light
In this world of sin and sorrow
Some glad morning we shall see Jesus in the air
Keep on showing the road to the final abode
Lord we need the light of love from Thy blessed throne above
There are many great inventions now
Wonderful the praise that is coming from heaven, over on the bright eternal shore
Heaven's throne ascending
Toward heaven, my Father's home, I steer
Heavenward doth our journey tend
Heavenward still our pathway tends
Heavy clouds are gathering fast
Heavy laden with thy grief
Behold what witnesses unseen
Father of peace, and God of love!
Jesus, the Son of God, who once
Where high the heav'nly temple stands
Men, arise and heed the service call
Heil'ger Geist, du treuer Hort
Heilig, heilig, heilig, Gott und Herr, allm'chtig
Heirs of unending life
See the children born of sorrow
I love my Savior more each day
Heâ€™ll come, the Judge will surely come
Behold the Man of sorrows, Who walking in Israel's land
I trudge along a lonesome road
Jesus is the Shepherd, looking now for you
Some days we feel so weak and work, our weary hearts by grief are torn
Loved ones and friends are parted
I'm a glad pilgrim on my way going to gloryland
Lord, when I read the traitor's doom
If your burdens heavy grow
If when you give the best of your service
My Saviour has promised He'll never forsake
Let your face be filled with sunshine
Help, LORD, because the godly ones have vanished
Help, Lord, for those who love Thee fail
Help, LORD, for those who love your truth have vanished
Help, Lord! the busy foe
Help, Lord, the godly fail!
Help, Lord; the godly Man decays
Help, Lord, to whom for help I fly
O wondrous story of the Lord
Help me, Jesus, to love my neighbor
Help me live each day on the pilgrim way
Help me, Lord, to be a Christian
In my darkest night I wait for you
Soldiers true are needed to defend the right
[Help Me, O God, And Hear My Cry]
I have found true joy and comfort in the blessed Savior's love
Help me sing on when my heart breaks in sadness
Bless this, our task, dear Lord
Oh, there are those who've wander'd long
O gracious Father, Friend unseen
Help us accept each other
Help us, Christ, to be peace-makers
Help us forgive forgiving Lord
Help us, in all we do and say
There's a battle fierce to wage, it should all our pow'rs engage
Help us, Lord, when we're scared of the risks we face
Help us, O Lord, behold we enter
[Help Us, O Lord, For None Remain That Love You]
Help us, O Lord, the good decay
Help us, O Lord, to bear the cross
Help us, O Lord, to learn
Help us to worship thee, Savior divine
Help us trace your rainbow colors
Oh, help your brother day by day
Helping Jesus! be my glory
Hence from my soul, my sins, depart
Herald of Jesus
Herald, sound the note of judgment
Heralds of Christ, who bear the King's commands
Heralds of creation! cry
The night is past, the heavy night of sorrow
Heralds of the King of kings
Herdsmen keeping lonely vigil
God has no hands but those that strive to mend
Long had I waited for you, O Lord
Lord, I give my life to You
Here am I, O Lord; I come to do your will
If the Savior wants somebody just to fill a humble place
We will strive to do the best we can
Here are my thoughts, Lord, here is my mind
Here as we kneel, here as we pray
You who labor for justice
Here at thy cross, incarnate God
Here before Thine altar fair
Here behold me as I cast me
Here come Thy little ones, O Lord
Let our praise be Your welcome
Here from all nations, all tongues, and all peoples
Here from the world we turn
Here hangs a man discarded
The fields are white unto harvest
Do not fear when the tempter calls you
Pull me out of the muddy mire
[Here I Am!  I Stand At the Door]
I, the Lord of sea and sky
You spoke my name and beckoned me to come
I waited for the Lord
Here I am, O Lord, to do your will
Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness
Here I can firmly rest
Here in joy we offer praises
Here in our upper room with thee,
Here in the harbor of my heart
Here in the Name of Christ our Lord
In the breaking of the bread, may we know the Lord
Here, in Thy Name, eternal God
Here in Your presence, Lord
Here is a canvas as broad as creation
Here is bread, here is wine
Here is love, wide as an ocean
[Here Is Love Vast As the Ocean]
[Here Is My Servant Whom I Yet Uphold]
Here is peace, when grace astounds us
Here is preached the gladsome tidings
Here is the beehive, where are the bees?
[Here Is the Center:  Star on Distant Star]
Here is the place for the lifting of burdens
[Here is the Risen Son]
Here is the tenfold sure command
Here, Lord, my soul convicted stands
Here, Lord, we offer Thee all that is fairest
Here, Lord, we take the broken bread
Here, O Lord, your servants gather
Here, O my God, I cast me at Thy feet
Here, O my God, low at Thy feet I bend me
Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face
[Here on the Threshold]
Here shall no Trouble or Dismay
[Here We Bring, Small or Great]
Here we gather to remember
Ding, ding, ding, ding
Here where dreams are more than visions
Here within this holy circle
Here young and old, here great and small
Hereafter thou shalt know; in this I rest
Here's a Savior for the lost ones
Here's my heart, my loving Jesus
O God, be merciful to me
Lord, who within my inmost heart
Oh, the joy and peace that is in my breast
How kind is His heart, how strong in His arm
Won't you come to Jesus, O come today
He's able, He's able, I know He's able
The Lord is risen from the dead
He is all I need
You may talk about silver you may talk about gold
He's bless'd whose tender care
He's blest, whose sins have pardon gain'd
This world is not the place for me, contented I shall never be
When Christ left this earth great sorrow did reign
He's come! let every knee be bent
When you are tired and lonely
I'm happy to say when Jesus came in
When the trumpet sounds the dead shall rise, oh, wonderful glory day
A wonderful promise we have from our Lord
I love my Lord with all my heart
What wonderful joy, what holy delight
He's coming back again
When the trump of God shall sound
I've read the gospel story, how Jesus came from glory
When Jesus left His throne on high
Our Lord shall come to earth again
O he's done so much for me
My Savior's love is sweeter still
A crown of beauty instead of ashes
In tender tones God whispered to our friend
He's got the whole world in his hands
I find him so precious in time of distress
Sing gladly, sing gladly
No one knows what a smile can conceal
If ninety and nine sheep are safe in the fold
There is no one so dear as Jesus
Since His peace and glory filled my soul with singing
The Lord is dearer to my soul than earthly wealth or fame
He's mine, he's mine, he's mine
When my Savior left His home in heaven to rescue me from sin
This world has its treasures of silver and gold
Some folk worship money and the lux'ry that it brings
When trials and tests
I love the Lord, for He's my friend
Since I trusted Jesus Christ my great Redeemer
Once I was sighing
I have a Friend Divine, walking with me
Each day I'm happy in my Savior since I believed
Once I was lost in sin, having no hope within
When all the world, enslaved by sin
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall never want
The world is full of constant friends who bless me with their love
He's no longer a stranger
Tho He came to earth and bore all our shame on the cross
He's risen, He's risen, Christ Jesus, the Lord
Our loved one has gone from this region of woe
He's so real, real in my soul today
Some people doubt the Lord
Hear the voice of your servant
I can't forget when I was sad
I thank the Lord for earthly friends
I know someone who watches over me all through the day
I've a precious Savior that I love and praise
Do life's burdens heavy press you hard and strong
As we labor and sing
Behold what manner of man is this
He's the One who makes me happy
He's the One I love
There's a mighty gospel calling, ringing out today
He's the Savior of my soul
He's trebly blest, who dreads th' omniscient God
[Hey My Love]
I walk in beauty, yes I do, yes I do
Hey, now, everybody sing
Jesus loved people and he made them friends
I'm hooked on Jesus; he's my Lord
Hid in the rock-cleft, let me stand
Hid with Christ, in God the Father
[Hidden Christ, Alive For Ever]
Hidden here before me, Lord, I worship you (Adoro te devote, latens Deitas)
Hidden, yet hurting, while need the comfort
Hide me in the shelter of Thy love
Jesus I'm fearfulâ€”for dark is the night
Hide, O hide me gentle Savior
O dear brother when the world is burning
When my heart is sore oppressed, And I seek in vain for rest
When the storms sweep o'er me on the journey here
In the Rock of ages hiding
Deep in Thy love O my gracious Redeemer
[Hiding Place]
High above us in the steeple
[High, Clear and Loud]
High up on the mountain or in the valley low
High let us all our voices raise
High o'er the hills the mountains rise
High on the throne of the Ancient of Days
Precious, holy blessed Savior
High Priest for sinners, Jesus, Lord
[High-Soaring Christ, You Look Beyond]
Shunning the lowlands where temptations are rife
Tho Satan's weights would pull me down
Higher, higher
Many are the things I cannot understand
Mary, highly favored one
Him dead and buried we confess
Him of the Father's Very Essence
Him on yonder cross I love
Him whom the skies, the earth, the sea
Him wilt Thou keep in perfect peace
Praise ye the Lord, let all things now adore him
For the islands and their people
[Hinei Ma Tov]
His angels keep you in all your ways
His are the thousand sparkling rills
I am my Beloved's and He is Mine
His battle ended there, death was overcome
Break, rosy light, in yonder sky
All hail the power of Jesus' name, The name I love so much to hear
His blood is all my plea
I have a friend who watches over me
I'm surely looking for the coming of the Savior, Lord and King
Lift Up your heads, ye saints, we're told redemption draweth nigh
Who can tell the hour of His appearing
Oh! what a joy when you listen to your Savior
God has a Son with the dearest name
Why should I feel discouraged
If Satan tempts me sore
Have you seen the Savior's face
I've a friend whose pow'r to save
Sweet is the praise to my Saviour given
There's nothing quite so cheering
We have been redeemed by love
His glorious name shall be called Wonderful
Praise ye the Lord among his saints
His glory, His glory
I'm happy today as gladly I bring
I'll sing of the goodness of God to me
I know that God's redeeming grace is keeping me each day
His grace is like a river
His grace is sufficient for me
On Jesus relying
A message in song I am bringing
Do you love the blessed Saviour?
There is a hand stretched out today
Sin clouds were over us, darkness before us
His hands were pierced, the hands that made
His hoary frost, his fleecy snow
Our Christ to His kingdom is bringing
My path was lonely, dark and drear
Yes, his little ones he holdeth
What a matchless Savior I have found at last
The Savior now walks with me and sweetly he talks with me
[His Love Endures Forever]
You have heard of the story of Jesus
Why did my Savior leave His throne
The world was lost in sin and shame
Rapture fills my trusting soul
When I was lost in sin and shame
Once I was lost all covered deep in sin
The love of Jesus, who can tell
The love that triumphed over death
His love, His love, His love is everlasting
I'm finding great joy in serving Jesus as I travel here below
I am walking daily by my Saviour's side
The love that Jesus had for me
The Savior who came from heav'n above, and proved to the world His matchless love
However dark the way may seem
I once was weary worn and sad
Sin-chains once bound me, I was weary and lone
You may speak of the love of a mother
The love of Jesus is my song
His love is wonderful to me
I have found my Redeemer and made Him my own
I've turned away from sin and shame
I'm happy as I go along, and there is naught to fear
Jesus is with me each moment I know
When the heart is filled with sighing
Glory to God my soul is forever free
His love means so much, so gentle His touch
His love passeth understanding
No longer I'm under the law's condemnation
I'm walking with Christ from day unto day
O I love my blessed Lord
The Lord is my keeper, and I am His reaper
There's a gentle voice that's calling, Softly calling from above
O sing away your grief and care
His mercies to the good will heav'n ensure
His mercy, and his truth
Far out on the cold rugged mountains of sin
[His Mother Said, "Jesus, Look"]
Honor His name, wonderful name
His name is called Emmanuel
I've found a true friend in my Saviour
His name is higher
When the dark shadows hang over your way
His name is Master, Savior
His name is Wonderful
Po' sinner, do you love Jesus?
Tell us, Zechariah
I've a message to bring you my brother
How sweet the dear Redeemer's Name!
I've learned to sing a glad new song
God so loved this old sinful world He sent His own Son
Sometimes I grow weary, discouraged and blue
His robes for mine: O wonderful exchange!
His sacred dwelling he doth found
When I reach my Father's dwelling
When I reach the golden portal
We go along all together in the service of song
His Spirit answers to the blood
His strength is perfect when our strength is gone
Why leave until tomorrow
His voice as the sound of the dulcimer sweet
His voice is in the thunder, in the storm
You are lost in sin, deeply stained within
When my way seems dark and drear and the future I don't kow
Would you live for Jesus,
His weary footsteps pulled the heavy load
His wide dominion shall extend
I am going home some morning, to that City bright and fair
When I was sore burdened and bound in sin
If the love of all ages since time was begun
O wonderful ransom, His own precious blood
Jesus, the Rose of Sharon
When dark is my day and weary my way
To God for help will I repair
I've found my Lord and he is mine,
His yoke is easy, his burden light
Hither and With One Accord
Hither, ye faithful, adoring triumphant
Hither, ye faithful, haste with songs of triumph
Why forsake the Lord
Ho, army of Endeavors
Ho, every one that thirsteth
Ho, everyone that thirsts, draw nigh
Ho! ev'ry one that thirsteth, come
Hold fast thy Faith dear heart opprest
Hold fast to Jesus
Hold fast your faith, faint not nor fear
Hold him tenderly, hold him gently
Because you are just who you are
Hold me, Lord
As I travel down the road of life
While I walk my pilgrim journey
Hold not thy Peace O LORD, our GOD!
Hold not thy peace, O Lord our God, No longer silent be
Keep yo' han' on de plow
Hold the thought, hold the tho't
Hold Thou my hand, dark is my way
Savior dear, hold Thou my hand
Hold Thou my hand! so weak I am, and helpless
Hold thou my hands!
It is joy beyond expressing
If the way seems dark and drear on your pilgrim journey here
By the cross of Christ I linger
Maker's love poured out from heaven
Hold your light a little higher
On our way
I am holding on to Jesus, One who cheers my weary heart
As I journey on my heart is singing
Holiness becomes thy house
Holiness is Your life in me

Holy Spirit of Messiah
Holy Spirit, once again
Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down
Holy Spirit, seal me I pray
Holy Spirit, still creating
Holy Spirit, still our sorrow
Holy Spirit, storm of love
Holy Spirit, Thou art welcome in this place
Holy Spirit, truth divine
Holy Spirit, we welcome you
Holy Trinity of Love
When silently the nightshades fall
Bend Thou all graciously, Father above
Strange that I am not cut down
Let us sing as we journey along
After the strain of battle
Spirit of God, attend my rising heart
Thereâ€™s a city bright and fair
Swiftly now life's sun is sinking
Home at last, thy journey ended
Tho the pathway we are treading
In that bright land above
There's a glad happy tho't in knowing that when life on this earth is o'er
When this earthly life is ended
Here there are trials and sore temptations
Home, kindred, friends, and country, these
We are traveling home to glory
Since I met the Savior and told Him my love
We read of a country where cometh no night
There's a beautiful home beyond the dark river
There's a place somewhere in heaven
Home to be with Jesus
On! To Golden portals
I am just a pilgrim here but I have a home
I am going to a country out beyond the rolling foam
In the land beyond the shadows
I am lonely tonight for my Savior
I sometimes get home-sick for heaven
Homeward now we journey with a joyful song
The pilgrim and stranger
Trav'ling on the sea of life we're homeward bound
From my Father's home I wandered
This earth is not my abiding-place, this world is not my home
Homeward I'm going to the City of rest
Singing of Jesus' love day after day
To the King Eternal, immortal
Honor and praise, O Christ, receive
Honor be to thee, O Spirit of Man
We're cadets that want to battle for the right, you see
Unto Christ, the mighty King
Glory, honor be to Almighty Jehovah
Hope for a child is a home that's secure
O God, my Sun, thy blissful rays
Hope is a candle, once lit by the prophets
Hope of Abraham and Sarah
When life brings you to the end of your rope
Hope of the Earth: your blessings are abused
You have no hope without Jesus
Hope of the world, O Christ of great compassion
And be it so, that till this hour
Hope shines as the solitary star
Often strange voices we hear in the night
"Hope is the anchor of the soul" When stormy billows o'er us roll
Hopeless to help in this violence, this crisis
While I to grief my soul gave way
Hosanna, Hosanna
[Hosanna]

When I look to the heavens, the work of your hands
How wondrous and great
How wondrous are the works of God
How would the Lord be worshiped
Ye who wander, of sin grown weary
Howe'er dispers'd, ye various nations, hear
Howeâ€™er the Nicolaitans claim
My Lord, how great's the favor!
Humble praises, holy Jesus
Humble souls, who seek salvation
Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
If thou wouldst have the dear Savior from heaven
Once perishing in blood I lay
Humbly in your sight
Humbly, my God, with Thee I walk
Humbly we adore thee, Christ Redeemer King
When the wounded spirit hears
Humility, thou secret vale
I am hungering, I am thirsting
Hung'ring for the sacred fire
Hungry and thirsty, Lord, we come
'Twas in the moon of wintertime
Hush, blessed are the dead
Hush! Hush! My soul be calm and still
Hush, little Jesus boy, hallalujah
Hush, my dear! Lie still, and slumber!
I'm so glad that trouble don't last always
Hush! the virginâ€™s song is ringing
Hush! then heed the silences
Hushed was the evening hymn
Jesus kneels in sorrow praying
'Twas on that dark, that doleful night
Nature, with all her powers, shall sing
Nature with open volume stands
How beauteous are their feet
My soul forsakes her vain delight
How full of anguish is the thought
Not to condemn the sons of men
When in the light of faith divine
Who can describe the joys that rise
No, I'll repine at death no more
Blest are the humble souls that see
Come, happy souls, approach your God
Raise your triumphant songs
Not the malicious or profane
And are we wretches yet alive?
Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard
O, if my soul were formed for woe
Shall we go on to sin
That awful day will surely come
Deceived by subtle snares of hell
Come, let us lift our joyful eyes
Now with our mortal eyes
Lord, we adore thy vast designs
No more, my God, I boast no more
Lord, how divine thy comforts are!
There was an hour when Christ rejoiced
I send the joys of earth away
And must this body die?
There is a house not made with hands
Zion, rejoice, and Judah, sing
Lord, we confess our num'rous faults
Great God! to what glorious height
So did the Hebrew prophet raise
The majesty of Solomon
How large the promise, how divine
I sing my Savior's wondrous death
Gentiles by nature, we belong
High as the heav'ns above the ground
Lord, how secure my conscience was
How can I sink with such a prop
Thus saith the first, the great command
I cannot bear thine absence, Lord
Behold the potter and the clay
Blood has a voice to pierce the skies
The law by Moses came
Laden with guilt, and full of fears
Christ and his cross is all our theme
How rich are thy provisions, Lord!
Jesus, the man of constant grief
The true Messiah now appears
The Lord declares his will
Faith is the brightest evidence
The law commands, and makes us know
Thus saith the mercy of the Lord
My God, permit me not to be
Do we not know that solemn word
Away from every mortal care
Behold the wretch whose lust and wine
'Tis not the law of ten commands
Deep in the dust before thy throne
Life and immortal joys are giv'n
With joy we meditate the grace
The Lord, descending from above
Not diff'rent food, or diff'rent dress
Thus did the sons of Abram pass
Come hither, all ye weary souls
Blest with the joys of innocence
O preach my gospel, saith the Lord
'Tis by the faith of joys to come
Saints, at your heav'nly Father's word
How sweet and aweful is the place
The lands that long in darkness lay
Sing to the Lord that built the skies
Attend, while God's exalted Son
Now by the bowels of my God
Let everlasting glories crown
Behold how sinners disagree
We bless the Prophet of the Lord
O let our lips and lives express
Eternal Spirit! we confess
Let Pharisees of high esteem
The promise was divinely free
Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews
Behold the woman's promised Seed!
Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell
The King of Glory sends his Son
God is a Spirit, just and wise
Behold the blind their sight receive
Now to the power of God supreme
This is the word of truth and love
Firm as the earth thy gospel stands
My dear Redeemer and my Lord
How oft have sin and Satan strove
Now have our hearts embraced our God
Who shall the Lord's elect condemn?
Welcome, sweet day of rest
Give me the wings of faith to rise
Mistaken souls, that dream of heav'n
My Savior God, my Sovereign Prince
Who has believed thy word
Not all the blood of beasts
Like sheep we went astray
What diff'rent powers of grace and sin
So new-born babes desire the breast
Great was the day, the joy was great
Why should the children of a King
I love the windows of thy grace
Jesus, in thee our eyes behold
Man has a soul of vast desires
Go, worship at Immanuel's feet
Now let a spacious world arise,
'Tis from the treasures of his word
Dearest of all the names above
With cheerful voice I sing
Eternal Sovereign of the sky
Join all the names of love and power
The memory of our dying Lord
Let me but hear my Savior say
Far from my thoughts, vain world, begone
Sin has a thousand treach'rous arts
Join all the glorious names
'Twas by an order from the Lord
Not to the terrors of the Lord
Sin, like a venomous disease
Where are the mourners, saith the Lord
Lo, the destroying angel flies
I hate the tempter and his charms
Now Satan comes with dreadful roar
Broad is the road that leads to death
Great King of glory and of grace
Now let our pains be all forgot
Hosannah to the royal Son
Lord, what a heav'n of saving grace
Let the wild leopards of the wood
Strait is the way, the door is strait
My thoughts surmount these lower skies
Dear Lord! behold our sore distress
Why should this earth delight us so?
Long have I sat beneath the sound
How shall I praise th' eternal God
Great God! thy glories shall employ
Jehovah reigns, his throne is high
The Lord Jehovah reigns, His throne is built on high
We sing th' amazing deeds
O for an overcoming faith
Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground
Can creatures to perfection find
Jesus! we bow before thy feet
Hear what the voice from heav'n proclaims
High on a hill of dazzling light
At thy command, our dearest Lord
Lord, at thy temple we appear
Let others boast how strong they be
Jesus invites his saints
My thoughts on aweful subjects roll
Ere the blue heav'ns were stretched abroad
Lord, we adore thy bounteous hand
Awake, my heart; arise, my tongue
Why is my heart so far from thee
Come, let us lift our voices high
Let the old heathens tune their song
Terrible God, that reign'st on high
Our spirits join t' adore the Lamb
Jesus, our Savior and our God
What vain desires and passions vain
Descend from heav'n, immortal Dove
Sitting around our Father's board
Absent from flesh! O blissful thought!
Must all the charms of nature, then
In vain the wealthy mortals toil
When the great Builder arched the skies
Father, we wait to feel thy grace
All mortal vanities, begone
My drowsy powers, why sleep ye so?
How are thy glories here displayed!
Blest be the everlasting God
Lord, we are blind, we mortals blind
Death may dissolve my body now
God! the eternal, awful name
Glory to God the Father's name
What mighty man, or mighty God
Stoop down, my thoughts, that use to rise
Let God the Father live
I lift my banner, saith the Lord
Jesus, with all thy saints above
Glory to God the Trinity
The promise of my Father's love
Behold, the grace appears!
Why do we mourn departing friends
In thine own ways, O God of love
Why should we start, and fear to die
Let God the Maker's name
When the Eternal bows the skies
O happy soul that lives on high
Whence do our mournful thoughts arise?
How short and hasty is our life!
Shall atheists dare insult the cross
Raise thee, my soul, fly up, and run
All glory to thy wondrous name
What shall the dying sinner do
Jesus, thy blessings are not few
Let them neglect thy glory, Lord
Honor to the Almighty Three
Not by the laws of innocence
Let those who bear the Christian name
O 'tis a lovely thing to see
Well, the Redeemer's gone
Lift up your eyes to th' heav'nly seats
The mighty frame of glorious grace
Do I believe what Jesus saith
Happy the heart where graces reign
I give immortal praise
How is our nature spoiled by sin!
Blessed Redeemer, how divine
Now shall my inward joys arise
Our days, alas! our mortal days
To him that chose us first
How condescending and how kind
Here at thy cross, my dying God
Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes
Questions and doubts be heard no more
What happy men, or angels, these
Our God! how firm his promise stands
To God the Father's throne
These glorious minds, how bright they shine!
Up to the fields where angels lie
To our eternal God
Adore and tremble, for our God
My God, what endless pleasures dwell
Now for a tune of lofty praise
Adam, our father and our head
How vast the treasure we possess!
With holy fear and humble song
Hosannah to the Son
He dies! the friend of sinners dies!
And is this life prolonged to me?
See where the great incarnate God
Thy favors, Lord, surprise our souls
Hosannah to the King
Up to the Lord, that reigns on high
Father, how wide thy glories shine!
Awake, my zeal; awake, my love
Must friends and kindred droop and die
Now to the Lord a noble song!
Awake, our souls; away, our fears
How vain are all things here below!
How strong thine arm is, mighty God!
Death cannot make our souls afraid
Let us adore th' eternal Word
Naked as from the earth we came
Lord, when my thoughts with wonder roll
Now be the God of Isr'el blessed
Now let the Lord my Savior smile
To God the only wise
Bright King of glory, dreadful God!
'Twas the commission of our Lord
Death! 'Tis a melancholy day
God, who in various methods told
Lord! what a wretched land is this
Jesus, we bless thy Father's name
My God, the spring of all my joys
When we are raised from deep distress
Thee we adore, Eternal Name
We sing the glories of thy love
No, I shall envy them no more
Backward with humble shame we look
Lord, how secure and blest are they
Let mortal tongues attempt to sing
Time, what an empty vapor 'tis!
In Gabriel's hand a mighty stone
Glory to God that walks the sky
Jesus is gone above the skies
Great God, I own thy sentence just
Once more, my soul, the rising day
Our souls shall magnify the Lord
Praise, everlasting praise, be paid
Now to the Lord, that makes us know
My soul, come meditate the day
Come, let us join our cheerful songs
Sing to the Lord, ye heav'nly hosts
What equal honors shall we bring
Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound
Behold what wondrous grace
Happy the church, thou sacred place
Let the seventh angel sound on high
Let him embrace my soul, and prove
There is a land of pure delight
Thou whom my soul admires above
Great God! how infinite art thou!
Behold the Rose of Sharon here
Father, I long, I faint to see
Begin, my tongue, some heav'nly theme
The voice of my Beloved sounds
When I survey the wondrous cross
Let every mortal ear attend
Dread Sovereign! let my evening song
God of the seas! thy thund'ring voice
Hark! the Redeemer from on high
The glories of my Maker God
Often I seek my Lord by night
Blest morning, whose young dawning rays
Daughters of Zion, come, behold
Hence from my soul, sad thoughts, begone
Kind is the speech of Christ our Lord
Is this the kind return
We are a garden walled around
From thee, my God, my joys shall rise
The wond'ring world inquires to know
Hosannah to the Prince of light
When strangers stand and hear me tell
Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears
Now in the galleries of his grace
When the first parents of our race
Who is this fair one in distress
Plunged in a gulf of dark despair
God of the morning! at whose voice
COME, Jet us join a joyful tune
How honorable is the place
Hosannah, with a cheerful sound
O! the almighty Lord!
Thus far the Lord has led me on
And now the scales have left mine eyes
God, how endless is thy love!
Arise, my soul, my joyful powers
Shall the vile race of flesh and blood
Thus saith the Ruler of the skies:
Not from the dust affliction grows
Come, all harmonious tongues
Jehovah speaks! let Isr'el hear
Why does your face, ye humble souls
The Lord on high proclaims
Our sins, alas, how strong they be!
How wondrous great, how glorious bright
Thus saith the high and lofty One:
Salvation! O the joyful sound!
Life is the time to serve the Lord
Hosannah to our conquering King!
Ye sons of Adam, vain and young
Let all our tongues be one
In vain we lavish out our lives
How sad our state by nature is!
Lo! the young tribes of Adam rise
O! the delights, the heav'nly joys
Now in the heat of youthful blood
Shout to the Lord, and let our joys
Shall Wisdom cry aloud
My God, my life, my love!
Thus saith the Wisdom of the Lord
My God, my portion, and my love
Infinite grief! amazing woe!
Not all the outward forms on earth
Down headlong from their native skies
But few among the carnal wise
From heav'n the sinning angels fell
Buried in shadows of the night
My heart, how dreadful hard it is!
How heavy is the night
Let the whole race of creatures lie
Vain are the hopes that rebels place
O Christ, of all Thy servants Guide
Refreshed we rise, and for this bread that feeds
Awake! the shining day is born!
Blest Cross-bearer, Source of good
Draw near, Almighty Father
Let me chant in sacred numbers, as I strike each sounding string
Let heav'n and earth rejoice, And sacred anthems raise
Why doth the sun re-orient take
Teach us the anthem of the saints
Joyous bands are meeting all our ranks among
Fountain of life, supernal Fire
Lift up your eyes, whoe'er ye be
Blest Lord, Creator of the glowing light
This is the day the Lord has made!
Jesus, once for sinners slain
O Jesus, Light of Bethlehem
Lord, we worship You
Jesus, thou my Savior art
[Hymn of Glory]
Lord of the harvest, Thee we hail!
O, sing to God in joyful lays!
To you, O God, our Father: alleluia!
In the bulb there is a flower
With thanksgiving, Lord, we come
Sing we now the praises
[Hymn of the Passion]
Christ our passover has been sacrificed for us
O God the deep immutable
Mary, chosen daughter holy
As angel hosts with heavenly songs
This is the time of song
Creating God, our praise we bring
Praise we the Father and the Son
O Father, whose mighty arm
I am a child of God
I am a child of God
I am a great complainer, that bears the name of Christ
I am a man created in God's image
I am a new creation
I am a part of the pulse of creation
I am a soldier, glory to God
I am a stranger
My end, Lord, make me know
I am a stranger here in solitude I roam
I am a stranger here below
I am a terrorist
I am a woman 
I am a wounded soldier
I am alone, yet not alone
I am, alone, your God and Lord
I am amazed when I think of God's love
Tossing on the billow
Jesus, in thy arms I'm resting
I am clinging to the Rock, blessed saving Rock
Gladly hearing, no more fearing
Sad and weary, lone and dreary
There is something strangely tender
Jesus, I am coming home today
Lone I wander, sad I roam from my happy childhood home
I am coming to the Saviour who can wash away my sin
I am content, my Jesus liveth still
[I Am Convinced]
I am crucified with Christ
I am determined to follow Jesus
When I first found Jesus something o'er me stole
I am fond of the swallow - I learn from her flight
I wandered out in sin's darkness, away from safety and light
I am free, free, free, Hallelujah! I'm free
I am free from condemnation
I am free from condemnation
O sing of fredom which Christ has bestowed
I am so glad that I sweetly can sing
This world is full of trouble
There is gladness in my soul, since the Saviour made me whole
Will you meet me bye and bye, there to life with Christ on high
I am going to my home on high
Some happy morning when my toiling is over
I am going to my home o'er the river
I am on my way to heaven, land of lasting joy and bliss
I wonder what will happen in glory
There is naught to trouble now
I have heard about a city far beyond the starry sky
I have heard about a country far above the sky
I am going home some happy day, my blessed Lord and King to see
As I travel on life's journey, to the City bright and fair
Since the Lord has saved my soul, made my happy free and whole
As a stranger I roam with no place to call home
There's a lovely city, made of purest gold
In a home of pure delight, built of many mansions bright
When I'm thru with toil and trouble in this world below
I am going over yonder to the land that's bright and fair
I am going up home on some wonderful day
As I travel along thru this troublesome land
I am going up to heaven, it will not be very long
I am gonna take a heav'nly journey
I am walking in the light and the way is smooth and bright
I'm treading life's road and bearing my load
I am happy in the Lord, sweetly trusting
Praise God for His redeeming grace
I am in the shining way, leading on to endless day
I am so happy to serve my dear Lord
I am happy to say I face heaven today
My feet are so glad to walk with my King
I'm happy today as onward I go
I've a Friend who watches me, shielding me from the wrong
I am healed by the wound in His side
I am hiding in the cleft of the Rock
Jesus died upon the tree
His life he gave
I was lost in sin and shame
My heart with joy is overflowing as to glory I am going
I've a friend close by my side
Storms may be sweeping me, Jesus is keeping me
Once I wandered far from Jesus, knowing not His grace divine
I am homeward bound as the love-light shines
I am in the army of Jesus, fighting for the truth and right
I am in the army of the Lord
I am in the light, of Jesus
I am into my garden come
I am Jesusâ€™ letter
I am Jesus' little lamb
I am Jesus' little lamb
I can't stay here so very much longer
On the way to glory land, to the bright eternal strand
Do you hear the Saviour calling
I one time placed glory-land over the sea
I am longing, Savior, longing
I am looking for a City in a land so bright and fair
I am loved, I am loved
I have lost my reputation
I'm trav'ling on the road of darkness here and troubled with doubt and fear
I am not alone; Christ, my Lord, is with me
I am not dreaming, When I am weary
I am not mine own
I am not skilled to understand
I am not under law, but under grace
I am not worthy, holy Lord
I am now a child of God since He saved my soul
Many years I did spend in the lowland of life
Out of sin's confusing shadows and away from gloom
I am on my way to Jesus
I once was lone and idle
I have heard the Savior calling "Come to me"
I'm living in a place where trouble I must face
On the cross of Calvary
My life, O Lord, to thee I now surrender
I am persuaded, that neither death nor life nor angels
I am persuaded that He is able to keep
I am persuaded that neither death, nor life
I have a Savior, he's pleading in glory,
When night time shall fall and the Saviour shall call
Throâ€™ the blood once shed for me
I am redeemed, bought with a price
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption
Once I was walking in the by ways of sin
Rock of my salvation keep me from harm while on the deep
Going to my home just over yonder, trusting in my Savior's boundless love
I am, saith Christ, the Way
On a sea of exploration, once I sailed with admiration
I'm so glad to tell you now my brother
I am saved by the blood of my Savior
I am free from condemnation since the Lord has made me whole
I'm a pilgrim and stranger in this lowland of sin
I am seeking a country, a beautiful country
Once my path was dreary and my heart was weary
I'm happy on the journey to glory land
I was lost in sin, Jesus took me in
I'm walking with my Savior today
I am so glad my Savior came into this world of sorrow and shame
I am so glad each Christmas Eve
I am so glad that our Father in heaven
I am so glad when Christmas comes
There's a day of rest awaiting for each pilgrim here below
I am still with thee
I have a Saviour, a wonderful friend
Twas a happy day when Jesus rescued me and saved my soul
I'm walking in the shining way
I am the light by which men see
I am the bread, the bread of life
I am the bread of life
[I Am the Bread of Life]
[I Am the Bread of Life]
[I Am the Bread of Life]
Whoever comes to me shall never hunger
I am the bread of life broken for the world
I am the food that the world cannot give
O God, my God, for you I long
I am the captain of my boat
O what shall I do to be saved?
I am the dream and you the dreamer
I am the God that healeth thee
I am the holy vine
I am the light of the world
"Arise," says the Lord
I am the living bread come down from heaven
I am the Lord, O hear my voice
I am the Lord, thy fathers' God
I am the LORD your God; you are my people
"Fear not, "your Maker now proclaims
Whether I live or die, Whether I wake or sleep,
I am the man who by his rod
I am the resurrection and the life
I have come to bring the truth
[I am the Resurrection and the Life] (Hurd)
I am the resurrection and the life
I am the resurrection and the life
I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley
[I am the Vine]
[I Am the Vine]
[I Am the Vine]
I am the vine; My Father is the gardener
I am the vine and you the branches
I am the one vine growing
If you love, then you must root yourself
[I Am the Way]
"I am the Way, I am the Truth, I am the Life," saith the Lord
Come to the Saviour, children, today
I am the way, the truth and the life
I am Thine, gracious Lord
I am thine, my blessed Lord
I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice
I'm thinking about a bright City, with mansions our Lord doth prepare
I am thinking of the danger of the life I used to live
Fear not when clouds arise
Singing happy praises as I travel here in the narrow way
I am trusting in my Savior
All my sins have been forgiven
I am trusting in You, O God
Savior, now I come to thee
I am trusting, Lord, in thee
I am trusting thee, Lord Jesus; At thy feet I bow
[I Am Trusting You, Lord Jesus]
I am unworthy to suffer with thee
I am waiting for the dawning Of the bright and blessed day
I am walking a path of peace
I am walking close to Jesus, and am happy in His love
I am happy in the love of my Savior dear above
Walking in the sunlight that around the blessed Lord is gleaming
Happy each day glad praise I'm singing
[I am who I am, I Will be who I will]
["I Am Who I Am" - Our Living God's Name]
I am with you always
I and my house are ready, Lord
I and my house will serve the Lord, But first obedient to his word
Oh, let me tell you, Mother
I began life's journey when young
I beheld, and lo a great multitude
I believe in God the Father
With my heart I believe on the Saviour
I believe, and now accept Him
I believe God answers prayer
If I were to tell you what someone told me
I believe I'll testify while I have a chance
There are things as we travel this earth's shifting sands
I believe in God the Father
I believe in God Almighty
I believe in God the almighty, Ninasadiki
I believe in God the Father
On God's word relying
I Believe in Jesus, I believe he is the Son of God
Creation shows the power of God
I believe in miracles, I believe in light
I believe in the word of God
I believe that God the Father
I believe the story, grand old gospel story
The love of God shines in his face
I believe You, Jesus
You made every part of me, and I belong to you
You ask me whom am I
I belong to Jesus
I belong to Jesus, He set me free
The thought that keeps me over life's road
I belong to the King, I'm a child of His love
I bind my heart this tide
I bind unto myself today
I bless the Lord who gives his word
I bow in silence at Thy feet
I bow my forehead to the dust
[I bow my Knee in Prayer]
Though you have wandered far, sin-stains your soul may mar
I brought my merits to the throne
I build my house upon a rock,--
[I Built a Garden]
[I Built My House on Rock]
I call, O Lord, on you
I call on thee, Lord Jesus Christ
I called to my God for help
I called upon the LORD in my distress
I came a wand'rer, and alone
I came to Jesus as I was
I don't know what you came to do
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
[I Can Do All Things]
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me (Clark-Terrell)
[I Can Do Everything Through Him]
Glory fills my being since Jesus pardoned me
I can feel you near me God
I remember in my childhood
I'm kneeling at the mercy seat
Now I can let all the troubles of this busy life go
O you compromising Christian on life's way
I can never be the same since that unforgotten hour
[I Can No Longer Celebrate Myself]
[I can on God implicitly rely]
I can see down yonder where I had my dwelling
I can see my pilot's face in every storm
As I wander thru this lowland
I can sing all the day
I can sing of my Lord with a jubilant voice
I can tell very well, spring is here
My soul once was lost in the byways of sin
I remember the time when in darkness I wandered
I cannot be idle, for Jesus says,
I cannot call affliction sweet
I cannot count Your blessings, Lord, they're wonderful
I cannot drift beyond his love
I cannot lift mine eyes
Oh, when I remember God's goodness to me
I cannot sing my old songs, my heart is not my own
I cannot tell why he whom angels worship
I cannot tell why He, the King of heaven
My Lord has done so much for me, thro' all the passing days
I cannot tell why the dear Savior should love me
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through
Once my poor soul was lost in sin
On Sunday you're a mighty fine fellow
We are constantly talking of heaven as home
You tell afar how good you are
I can't tell you why salvation cost the blood of Christ the Lamb
I was oh, so lone and sad, lost and all undone
I celebrate the inward light
The world has much to lure and charm
I come, dear Lord, to thee, as thou
I come from the lofty heavens today
I come invited by thy word
I come, O God, to take your touch
I come, O Lord, my God, to Thee
I come, O Savior, to Thy table
"I come," the great Redeemer cries
I come to the cross seeking mercy and grace
I come to Thee, dear Savior
I come to Thee, O blessed Lord
I come with joy to meet my Lord
I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
There've been times when giving
I could not do without Thee
I could not get along without my Bible
I could not understand
Over the mountains and the sea 
Oh, I could sing unending songs
If I had all the words in our language
In de valley, Couldn't hear nobody pray
I cried aloud to God for help
I cried aloud, unto the Lord
[I Cried Out For God to Help Me]
I cried out to God to help me
I cried to God in my distress
Well! I cried unto the Lord and He saved my soul
I cry for mercy to the LORD
I danced in the morning when the world was begun
I declare a brand-new me
I delight greatly in the Lord
I did resolve to guard my ways
I do believe, I now believe
I do believe, I will believe
I know a great Savior, I do, don't you
I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be
[I Do Not Know Tomorrow's Way]
Every day while walking along
I don't feel no ways tired
I've been sick but God bro't me
You may ask me why I'm missing all the worldly pleasure here
I don't know why Jesus loved me
In this world we have our troubles, Sometimes lonesome, sometimes blue
WEAVER divine, thy matchless skill
I DWELL within the secret place
Praise God I enjoy my religion
For Thou Lord, art high above all the earth
Just like a child I come to Him in joy or in despair
Prince of Peace, Counselor
I extol you, O Lord
I fall asleep in Jesus' wounds
I'm just a pilgrim here, I journey day by day
As I tread life's rugged way I am trusting ev'ry day
I feel Jesus, I feel Jesus
Here so often I'm lonely, here so often I'm blue
Went to the graveyard the other day 
A wonderful song is ringing
My heavenly home is bright and fair, I feel like traveling on
I have a revelation in my heart
I feel so much better when I praise the Lord
I feel spring in the air today
I have truly found a friend in
While passing down time's weary road, I'll murmur not tho great the load
I feel the touch of Heaven within my blood-bought soul
I find my all in Jesus
I find myself placed in a state of probation
I find no fault in Christ my Savior
I firmly on the Lord rely
I first invented in Thy praise
O Saviour of the lost, where should I flee
I am following the King of whose love I sing
My heart was lonely one day, when I had wandered away
Once I was just a sinner, the Lord, I did not know
I found my God in early years
I found sweet peace in Christ my Lord
I get so excited, Lord
I give all my service to You
I give my heart to Thee, O Jesus most desired
I give thee my best, nothing less, nothing less
I give You all the honour
I give you love, and how do you repay?
This is my desire, to honor You
I go to heaven, there is my home
I greet my sure Redeemer and my King
In my deepest dream I hear
I had a dream that I was standing on a hillside
"I have a dream," a man once said
"I have a dream!" From prophet's word
I do not tread earth's path alone
I have a friend so patient, kind, forbearing
As I am trav'ling on my homeward way
I have a friend in Jesus
[I Have a Future All Sublime]
I have a garden in the park
As on I go from day to day
In dreams I go back to the scenes of my childhood
I'm just a pilgrim mid earth's sorrow
I am only on a journey in this wilderness below
All along life's lonely pathway
I have a mansion in the City above
I have a new song deep down in my soul
I have a pilot who guides me
I have a puzzle of the world
I have a Savior so loving and true
I have a Saviour who's mighty to keep
Since I came to Jesus and He took me in
I have a thought that fills my mind
Gone is my burden of sorrow and shame
I have been alone with Christ my Saviour
My heart knew darkness
My glad heart is singing by day and by night
I have been through the world
I have borne the lark's swift pinions
I have cast my burden on the Saviour
I have chosen thee, my Savior
In the heart of London city
I have decided to follow Jesus
Since my Savior saved me from sin, joy bells now are ringing within
I have followed truth and justice
I have found a resting place in the sweetness of His grace
I have found at last the Savior
I have found the opened fountain
I have found the peace of heaven
I have found the way that leads to heaven's happy land
I have given my cares to Jesus
My heart is aglow with the heavenly flame
I have heard about a City over on the shining strand
I have heard of a tree, a great Christmas tree
I have heard the call of Jesus
Earth holds pleasures once so charming to me
I have a wonderful Savior walking with me
[I Have Kept the Faith]
Seek the face of the Lord
I have made a covenant with my chosen
I have my troubles here below
Wind and wave are tossing me, like a ship unto the sea
Once the sinful way seemed right to me
I have no other comfort
I have no tears to shed
I have nothing to show on tomorrow
Ev'rywhere I go there is grief and woe
I have seen His Star, Through my darkest night
I have seen the face of Jesus
I have seen the Light shining in the darkness
I am thinking today of a home o'er the way
I have taken up my cross for Jesus
I have found the Savior precious, And I love him
I've the Blesser and the blessing
O blessed tide that cleanses sin
I have the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
I hear a loving voice
[I Hear Angels]
[I Hear Creation Groaning]
I hear in the air 'neath the canopy blue
In my soul I hear my Savior calling
I hear the bells of heaven ringing
I hear the Savior calling!
I hear the sound of rustling in the leaves of the trees
I hear the sound of the army of the Lord
I hear the voice of Jesus, He's calling me me to-day
I've friends who've journeyed on ahead
Dreary clouds were gath'ring o'er us murky was the sky
I hear thy welcome voice
I heard a great voice from heav'n
I heard a song, a song of hope and cheer
I heard a sound of voices
Voices of dear ones so often we hear
I heard the voice from heaven, saying to me
While kneeling by her bedside on the cottage on the hill
I was listening in to a radio station
I heard the bells this festive day
I heard the cantor singing
How long did it rain? Can any one tell?
I heard the voice of Jesus say
I hide Your Word within my heart
I hold to the hand of my Savior and friend
When the call from the skies bids the blood washed arise
I hope in the Lord
In that land of joy eternal is a City free from care
[I hunger and I thirst]
I in JEHOVAH place my trust
I just want to tell you brother, what Jesus did for me
I just want to praise You
When Jesus called me thru His blessed word
I kneel at the cross in contrition
I know on whom my faith is fixed,
I know the Redeemer is mighty
You ask me how I gave my heart to Christ
I know a flower so wondrous fair
I know a fount where sins are washed away
SAY, are you weary? Are you heavy laden
I know a lovely angel-game
I know a place, a wonderful place
My sins once were deeper than the crimson
I know he cares for me
To Jesus my Savior I cling
I know one kind Shepherd, a true, faithful Guide
I know my Savior leads me onward by the power of His hand
When I was far astray, going the downward way
Once my heart was proned to sin and would not let the Savior in
From the Lord I wandered into sin astray
If from the straight and narrow way
I know he's mine, this friend so dear
Some think so, they hope so, they trust so, they guess so
I know there is a brighter world than this
I know I have a mansion awaiting now for me
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, yes, I know
Dearly I love my Redeemer
As I walk thro' the valley of shadows at last
I'm clinging to my Savior dear
I love so to read the old story
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger in this dreary troubled land
I know I'll go sometime to a home sublime
Sweet is the hope that is thrilling my soul
When I read the blessed word of Jesus
I Know I'm saved, for my sins are washed
When I read how my Savior was nailed to the cross
I know it was the blood
I know it was Your love for me
I'm happy in Jesus my Savior, My sins He hath taken away
There's a place in Jesus where the soul may find
I know my faith is founded
I'm gonna leave this world some happy time
I know, my God, and I rejoice
I know my Jesus saves me
I was going on with no aim in life
I'm going home some happy day
Oft I've heard my mother tell
My name is in the book of life,
I owe my all to the blessed Lord
I know not how that Bethlehem's babe
I know not what the future hath
I know not where the road will lead
I know not why God's wondrous grace
I know, O God, I need Thy watchful care
I know of a sleep in Jesus' name
I know of a sleep in Jesus' Name
I came to Jesus lost, undone
The day may lose its sunshine and song
When from my Lord I wandered, He came to me one day
I know that my Redeemer lives, And ever prays for me
I shall see my Savior's face
I know that my Redeemer lives 
I know that my Redeemer lives
I know that my Redeemer lives
I know that my Redeemer lives - glory, hallelujah
I know that my Redeemer lives, He lives, and on the earth shall stand
I know the Bible was sent from God
I know the doom that must befall me
I know the Lord has made a way for me
I know Thee, Savior! God Thou art
How beautiful is this lovely old earth, with flowers in bloom
I know there's a rest that remaineth for me
O Jesus, I know Thou art mine
[I Know What Faith Is Yours]
I was lost in sin's dark night, wand'ring to and fro
I do not know what lies ahead
I don't know about tomorrow
I know whom I believe in
I know whom I'm believing
Our Father's all abounding love
I know with full assurance
I l-o-v-e, love you, Lord
My righteous God, who oft of old
I lay my sins on Jesus
I lean upon no broken reed
I leave all things to God's direction; He loves me both in joy and woe
I leave, as you have promised, Lord
I leave thee not, thou art my Jesus ever
I left it all with Jesus
I left the God of truth and light
I lie, O Lord, within Your care
I lift mine eyes unto the hills and to the boundless sky
[I Lift My Eyes to See]
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills
I lift my eyes up
I lift my eyes up to the hills
[I Lift My Eyes Up to the Hills]
I lift my eyes up to the hills
I lift my hands
I call you, Lord; come now to help me!
I lift my hands, and with my heart
I lift my heart to God on high
I lift my heart to Thee
Lord make me know your ways
Guide me in your ways, O God
[I Lift Up My Eyes]
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
I lift up my eyes to the mountains: When shall come my help?
[I Lift Up My Eyes to You]
I like the sound of America
I live, I live because He is risen
I live, and I know the span of my years
Long years in sin my soul was lost
O beautiful home far over the sea
I long for your commandments
I have a home beyond the skies
Far beyond the azure heavens
I long to know thee better, To understand Thy will
I've set my affections on heaven above
Jesus and may I work for thee
The Savior is coming from glory some day
[I Look Not Back]
When I am destitute of friends
He will not allow
I look to Thee in every need
I went on a visit
I lost my burdens at Calvary
I love, because JEHOVAH doth
I love God's Word so precious
I love him, though unworthy ever
I love Him, I love Him
You ask why I am happy
All my life long I have heard of Jesus
I love Him better ev'ry day
I love Him in the morning hour
I've a friend from a kingdom supernal
I love His appearing, don't you?
I love, I love thee, Lord most high
A slave to sin, condemned to die, I wandered in the night
I love my blessed Saviour
I love my God, but with no love of mine
[I Love My Great Lord]
I love my Jesus quite alone
I love my Jesus, King and Lord
I love my Lord because He heard my voice
I love my Lord, He is my Friend
Oh, I love my blessed Lord
O I love my blessed redeemer
I love my dear Savior who grants me His favor
Jesus, the name high over all
I love my Savior
Jesus, my heavenly King, loves me, I know
I have a Saviour, loving and true
Out upon the mountain straying, one lone sheep was lost
I love that Holy Scripture
I love the dear old Army flag
I love the Holy Bible
I love the Lord, His strength is mine
I love the Lord with all my heart, For he hath bid all sin depart
I know I am a child of God
I love the Lord with all my heart
I love the Lord and praise His name
I've been invited to a great Jubilee
I love the Lord, because he hath heard
I love the Lord, because my voice And prayer heard hath he (Norton)
I love the blessed Savior divine
I love the LORD, for he has heard my voice
I love the LORD, for he has heard my voice
[I Love the Lord, For He Has Heart My Plea]
I love the Lord, for my request
I Love the Lord; He heard my voice
I love the Lord; He lent an ear
"I love the Lord" is still the strain
I love the Lord, the fount of life and grace
I love the Lord, who heard the voice
So often I am dreaming of days that used to be
I love the name of heaven's abode
I love the name of Jesus
I love the volume of thy word
My Jesus, I love Thee, I love Thee, I do
I love thee, God, yet not for hope
I love Thee, my Saviour
I love thee, my Saviour, I love thee, my Lord
I love thee, O most gracious Lord
I love thee, O my God, and still
I love thy way of freedom
I love Thy Zion, Lord
While pressing on my pilgrim way
I love to hear sweet voices sing
I love to hear the story
I love to hear the story
I love to praise Him
I am happy in the service of my blessed King
I love to serve my Jesus, a privilege so sublime
I love to sing in the morning of Christ who died for me
I love to sing the story of Jesus and His love
I love to sing the praise of God
I love to tell the story
In that happy home up yonder
I love to think about that home
I love to think of Jesus and His love
I love to walk with Christ, the Lord
As on thro' life I go, meeting both friend and foe
For the redeeming agony
I love you, I love you, Lord, my strength
I love you Lord
I thank You, Lord, for all You've done
I love you, LORD, my strength, my rock
I love you, LORD, my strength, my rock 
I love You. I love You. I love You, Lord, today
I love you, my Jesus, I love you, my Lord
I love you, O Lord, you alone
I love You with the love of the Lord
I love your church, O Lord
I made a little á¸¥allah
I may live in a great big city
I may not go tonight to Bethlehem
Before me lies a world in sin
Amid the bustle of this busy life
While wending my journey thru this sinful land
I mercy will and judgment sing
[I Met a Man Who Had Two Coats]
Since by faith I came trusting in His name
O I met my Lord one morning, O it was a happy day
I met my loving Savior at the cross
[I Met the Good Shepherd]
I mused within my heart
Long have I sought the heavenly way
As I slip away on my journey
Earth to me holds many a treasure
If I ever reach that happy home above
In my heart the bells are ringing
I must tell Jesus all of my trials
This bread is spirit
I need a queen, a brand-new queen
I need God's blessings while I live
I need Jesus, my need I now confess
I need the love of my Lord, the saving pow'r of His word
I need thee, Lord, for life is sometimes dreary
Precious Jesus, loving Saviour
I need Thee, blessed Jesus
I need thee every hour
I need thee, precious Jesus
I need you, Lord, for I have seen
More than the air I breathe
O God, I need you to. I want to see your face.
I need your help, O LORD, my God
I never saw a sunny day
[I Never Asked for Sight]
I never can forget that day, When Jesus washed my sins away
O wonderful story which never grows old
Oh, what could I do with my sorrows
I never knew the depths of love
I never knew, until the Saviour found me
[I Never Looked For Jesus]
O Thou in whom I now believe
Some people may forget they say
Long years ago when out in sin
I never will leave thee, oh, be not afraid
Lord, I offer my life to You
All that I am, all that I have
I often wonder why it is
I on the Lord with confidence rely
I once was a Christian for many a year
I once was so certain, so righteous, so strong
I know not why Godâ€™s wondrous grace
I ought to love my Savior;
I ought to love my Savior
I owe my Lord a morning song
I pause a moment while I play
I place an offering at thy shrine
I plead thy love, my gracious Lord
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
I praise the king with all my verses
I praise Thee, O my God and Father
I praise you for I am wonderfully made
I praise you, Lord, with all my heart
I praise you, O God, with all of my heart
I praise your justice, LORD, with my thanksgiving
[I Pray that the Eyes of Your Heart]
I pray Thee, dear Lord Jesus
I prayed and I prayed, blessed Jesus has answered
The Son of God is by my side
Temptation my soul may assail
I raised my eyes unto the Lord
There's a home where glories gleam brighter than the fondest dream
I'll do anything just for my God
I'm glad that I know Him
I really love the Lord!
Jesus says: I am the Bread
I believe Thee! I receive Thee!
I receive You, O spirit of love
I receive Your love
Jesus said: I am the bread
Ev'ry hour of day, on the homeward way
I rejoiced when I heard them say
I rejoiced when I heard them say
I remember as my mind rolls back
Where He may lead me I will go
[I Remember Jesus' House]
[I Rest Beneath God's Sheltering Wings]
My hope is in the Lord, my honour and strength
The cares of this world were so heavy, my life was so empty and bare
I run to Christ when chased by fear
I said, I will take heed
I said, I will take heed to my ways
I saw an angel in the road
I saw him in childhood with eyes brightly beaming
When I enter heaven's glory
I saw the light, God's holy light
I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
[I Saw the Poor Ones Bring Their Child]
I saw the rich ones I saw what they gave
The water flowed, Alleluia!
When your hour had come and they pierced you, Lord
I saw water, flowing clear
I say to all men, far and near
[I See a New Heaven]
This war our sky has overcast, but peace will surely come at last
I see perfection as I look in Your eyes, Lord
I see the Christ among the crowd;
[I See the Lord]
I see the morning breaking
I have a precious Friend who's leading me on
I see thee stand, O Lamb of God
I see Thee standing, Lamb of God
I seek my refuge in you, LORD
I seek the kingdom first
I send my love unto my dead each day
I send you out, go as I went before you
I serve a risen Savior
I set myself against the Lord
I set the Lord before my eyes
I shall approach the altar of the Lord
Fill'd with my sin to the Saviour I came
When I shall awake in that fair morn of morns
There is a land, a beauteous land
Trials befall me, but day by day
Enemies oft I meet who would my aims defeat
I'm going to a city bright and fair
I shall know him, I shall know him
When the roll is called in heaven and we answer to our names (Buffum)
I shall lead you with mine eyes
When this busy life is ended
I'm thinking of my Savior
When this life is over and I've reached the journey's end
For all the Savior has done for me
Glory, hallelujah, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
When my cross is heavy
Anchored in Jehovah, I shall not be moved
I shall not walk alone, while Christ is near
I am moving day by day to a city over the way
On some tomorrow with trials past
Twilight shadows come with the dying day
I have had sweet dreams of my eternal home
Today I sing the wonderful story on the great highway leading to glory
This is the hope I cherish
There's a song my heart is singing as with Christ I go along
The perfect will of God I may not see
We shall walk streets of gold
I should be getting to know You
I sing a maid of tender years
I sing a new song
I sing a new song
I sing a simple song of love
I sing a song of the saints of God
I sing a song to Jesus Christ
I sing a song which doth belong
I sing as I arise today
I do not know the depths of love my Savior bore for me
I sing praises to your name, O Lord
I sing the birth was born tonight
I sing the grace of God within you
I sing the praise of Love almighty
I sing this song
I sing to thee with voice and heart
I sing with exultation, All my heart delights
I sojourn in a vale of tears
I sometimes think it's almost too good to be true
I sought the Lord, and afterward I knew
I sought the Lord at early morn
I stand amazed in the presence
I stand before the presence of the Lord God of hosts
I stand beside Thy manger here
You are beautiful beyond description
At the dawn of eternity
I stood on de ribber ob Jerdon
I suffer fruitless anguish day by day
I surrender, I surrender
Here I am, down on my knees again
I take my refuge in the LORD
I take the journey of a day
As I sat alone in the evening
Sometimes when my pathway I hardly can see
I thank the Lord for you, my friend
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown
I thank Thee, Lord, for all that Thou has done for me
I thank thee, Lord, that in thy blood
I thank thee, uncreated Sun
[I Thank You, Father]
I thank you, Jesus
[I Thank You, Lord, With All My Heart]
I that am drawn out of the depth
I am the resurrection
I then shall live as one who's been forgiven
I think I could work in a castle
I think I'm right but I could be wrong
I think of all his sorrow
I think, when I read that sweet story of old
I thirst, thou wounded Lamb of God
I thought to guard my ways with care
I thought upon the days of old
[I To the Hills Lift Up My Eyes]
I to the hills will lift my eyes
I to those mountains lift mine eyes
I too will magnify the Lord
I took a plunge in the crimson flood
My Lord was passing my way one day
There is a path I cannot trace
I trust in Him, the One who came
Jesus my Friend, my Lord, my King
I trust in Thee, O Lord
I trust, O Christ, in You alone
I trust, O Lord, Your holy name
[I Trust the Lord for Safety]
When the storms of life assail and toss my little bark
I turn to you, Lord, in time of trouble
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above
Tho shadows dark drift o'er my way and hide the golden sun from view
I waited for the LORD
I waited for the Lord Most High
I waited long upon the LORD
I waited meekly for the Lord, Till He vouchsafed a kind reply
I waited meekly for the Lord, Who heard my mournful cry
I waited patiently for God
He took my feet from the miry clay
I waited patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me and heard my calling
As I travel on the road to the final soul's abode
I am walking with my Redeemer on the Glory-land road
I walk with Thee, and in the dewy morning
Every step I take is a step of faith
I walk in danger all the way
I walk in danger everywhere
In the new found way, the gospel highway
I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground
I have a Guide close by my side
I walk with the blessed Lord and Savior, trying hard to win His grace and favor
I am walking with the Savior
When I am lonely and sad, my Savior makes me so glad
I once was worn and sad, but now I'm free and glad
I walk with Jesus each day along the beautiful way
In sorrow I wandered, my spirit opprest
I walked today where Jesus walked
I wandered sore distressed
I want a principle within of watchful, godly fear
I want an heart to pray
I want ev'rybody to know
I need the blood to me applied
I want Jesus to walk with me
Lord I want more love in my heart
I want my life to count for Jesus
When life shall end, my soul ascend
When the time comes for me to leave this world of sin and care
I want my Savior near me with his hand in mine
I want no other argument
I want the gift of power within
I care not for earth's treasures, it's silver and it's gold
When Jesus came down from Heaven above
Down in this lonely and troubled land
I want to be a light
Are you satisfied, Lord, with the work that I've done
I want to be a soldier of the cross
I want to be a tree that's bearing fruit
I want to be a worker for the Lord
I want to be an angel
I want to be as close to you
God gives to all His children
I want to love my Savior as on I go
I'd like to be here when Jesus shall come
I am traveling on to a heavenly home
I have one deep, supreme desire
Through all the changing scenes of life, I want to be more like Jesus
[I Want to Be Ready]
The great day is nearing
When I hear the trumpet sounding and the dead shall rise
I want to be ready when Jesus comes
I'm drawing nearer to the end of life's way
While trav'ling thru this world dear Lord, there's trouble on ev'ry hand
I know I am a sinner in the sight of God
In the home of song and beauty
I'm just a pilgrim here below
There's coming a day when homeward I go
I'm lonely down here, I want to go home
God calls to me: "Come forth from your grave."
Always I'm ready and willing
When I reach my home in Heaven where no sorrows betide
I want to follow my Lord and my Master
I am only on a visit in this troubled land
I want to go and live with Jesus
I want to go back to that little old shack
I'm looking for my Savior, I know He'll soon be here
There's a land of glory far beyond the sky
We read of a place that is called Heaven
I want to go home when Jesus in mercy calls for me
They tell of a city far up in the sky, I want to go there, I do
I've heard of a City with streets of pure gold
Sweet heaven our home is waiting above
Oft I think of friends who have gone away
I've traveled long in this old world, thru storms of ev'ry kind
There is a home beyond the skies
I want to go to Heav'n, I do
The Lord is my shepherd, and I want to follow
There's a land of fadeless beauty across the mystic sea
While going thru this pilgrim land
There will be a wondrous singing over in the glory land
While here I journey along I'm gladly singing a song
A wonderful change that made me happy, giving me blessed hope indeed
For what the Lord has done for me
I want to know You
I want to learn to appreciate You
I want to listen carefully
I want to work for Jesus until I reach the crossing
Since I've been pardoned from my sins
I want to live right, that God may use me
I'm planning some day, to leave this old world
There's a beautiful home, waiting over the foam
My heart is fixed on Jesus, for He's my all in all
I want to serve my King and to Him tributes bring
I want to see my dear old mother
A happy song the whole day long is mine to sing
Praise with the trumpet
When mother and daddy were here on this earth
Beyond the setting sun
There soon will be a great meeting far up in the skies
My dear mother has gone to that beautiful home
I want to see that city fair
This world of sin heart-aches and sorrow
I want to see Your face
While traveling thru this world below, so often I'm weary as I go
I want to serve the purpose of God
I want to serve you, Lord
Come along, friend, and go with me to the bright land across the sea
I want to tell each day, what Jesus did for me
I want to sing it, I want to shout it
I would lift my voice
As I go sailing along I am singing a song
There is a land of sweetest music where God's children ever sing
I will soon have had enough of this road that is so rough
I want to tell what God has done
Father, Your love I feel
I am happy as on I travel
I want to walk as a child of the light
Lord, I want to walk the highway leading out beyond the blue
I want to walk with Jesus Christ
I want to worship the Lord with all of my heart
I want you to share my Father's love with me
Jesus is such a dear Savior to me
I was a wandering sheep
One night I dreamed of flying up in the air
I was filled with joy and gladness
[I Was Glad]
[I was glad]
I was glad when they said unto me
I was glad, I was glad
I was glad, glad when they said unto me
I was glad they came to call me
[I was glad when they said to me]
I was glad when they said unto me
I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go to the house of the Lord (Burroughs)
Cause for rejoicing I found one day
I was on your mind
Jerusalem our home, Alleluia
I was sick, I was sad, and you visited me
"I was there to hear your borning cry
I was wandering in the wilderness
O brothers lets go down, let's go down, let's go down
[I Went, Lord, to the Temple]
I will accept His offer now
I will always bless the Lord
You may hear some people say they're saved by grace
[I Will Arise]
I will arise and go, Back to my Father's home
I will arise and seek Thy face
I will at all times bless the LORD
Remain in me, as I remain in you
You are my people, and I am your God
I will sanctify my name, O people
[I will bless the Lord]
[I Will Bless the Lord]
I will bless the Lord and give Him glory
I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth
Ev'rywhere I am
[I will bless the Lord at all times]
[I Will Bless the Lord At All Times]
I will bless Thee, O Lord
I will bless your name for ever, O God my king
[I will bless your name forever]
Lord, I will bow to you
[I Will Build My Church]
I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised
I will call upon the name of the Lord
I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord
I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord
I will change your name
I will come and bow down at Your feet, Lord Jesus.
Precious words of faithful
I have wandered away from the Father
I will cry mercy
I will delight in singing
I will do a new thing in you
I have deserv'd it, cease t' oppose
When the way seems long and dreary, Full of care and toil and pain
I will ever sing Thy praises
I will exalt my God and king
[I Will Exalt You, God, My King]
I will exalt you God my king, Forever bless your holy name
I will exalt you, God, my king
I will exalt you, O Lord, because you have raised me up
I will exalt you, O my God and king
Only a little Longer to roam
I will extol thee, God, my King
I will extol Thee, O Lord
I will extol you, O my God
When I'm lonely I go to Jesus
I will follow Thee, my Savior
All Your ways are good
I will follow thee, my Savior
I have heard the Savior calling, into all the world go ye
Lord, I will follow anywhere
Did you hear the voice of Jesus
Follow, follow, I will follow Jesus
Once I lived in darkness, the light I could not see
When the Lord was walking by the sea one day
There's a light that is shining above me today
I will follow thee, my Savior
I have wandered far away
I will follow thee, all my treasure
I will follow Thee, my Savior
I will follow where He leadeth
I will forever sing of your great love, O LORD
'Twas night at a bar that had long been made
I seek the Lord who answers me
I will give thanks unto thee O Lord, with my whole heart
I will give thanks with my whole heart
I will give You praise
I will give you rest
I will glory in my Redeemer 
I will gloryfy thee, O God, O God, my King
I will go and tell my Savior
Praise ye the Lord ye Gentiles all, Which hath brought you into his light
The Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
Come, my child, for I will teach thee
I will have no one but Jesus
As I go along life's rugged pathway
I will leave my Jesus never
When my journey here is o'er and I start for heaven's shore
I will leave this place and go to my father
I will lift the cloud of night before you
I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains
I will lift up mine eyes to the mountains
You are my God, whom I seek with my life
I will look, and I will see
I will love the Lord; for He
I will love thee, all my treasure
I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength
I will love thee, O my Strength
I will magnify thee O Lord, for thou hast set me up
I will magnify Thy name above all the earth
Here we talk and sing together of the Savior's precious love
O my brother, time is flying, here we cannot stay
Often here we have sorrow, and oft it is pain
I will meet you in the morning, I will meet you by and by
Some glad morning bright and fair, I will meet you over there
I've a mansion way up in glory in that City not made with hands
I receive so many blessings daily
If I owned all the gold and the silver
When my sins as mountains rise 
I am often tossed and driven
I will not always walk this earth
When the time shall come for me to go from this world of wickedness
I will not die before I've lived to see that land
I will not let Thee go; Thou Help in time of need!
I will not yield my sword
Whatever the Master commands me to do
I will own a new home in Jerusalem grand
His chosen people to restore
When I saw the cleansing fountain
O I will praise the Lord who bought me,
I will praise the Lord my glory
I will praise you, Lord, you have rescued me
I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me
The Lord is gracious and full of compassion
I will give you glory, O God my King
You are kind and full of compassion
I will praise your name for ever, Lord
I will praise your name for ever, my King and my God
I will praise your name for ever, my King and my God
I will extol you, O my God and King
With folded hands upon my breast
I will press on to perfection
I will put my law in their minds
I will praise the Father
I will rejoice, I will be glad
Within my heart there is a peace
I will rejoice, I will rejoice
I will rejoice in You and be glad
Sweet is the hour at the dawn of the morning
What was lost in battle
You give rest to the weary
[I Will Sing]
[I Will Sing]
I will sing a song of triumph
I will sing about Your love
Everywhere I go in this world below
When I was lost and far away from God, going deeper into sin
I will praise the name of Christ, my Savior
[I Will Sing, I Will Sing]
I will sing my Maker's praises
While songs resound thro' all the earth
I will tell the story of my Savior's love
I will sing of my redeemer
I will sing of my Redeemer who is all to me
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever
I will sing the story of your love, O Lord
I will sing the wondrous story
I will sing the wondrous story, Of salvation full and free
I will sing unto the LORD
I am traveling through a world of sadness
I will speak out for those who have no voices
With the help of God I will cling to Him
If you say to  me "Father, I am blind"
"I will take heed and guard my ways," I said
I have a story each moment to tell
When times of temptation bring sadness
I will click my fingers, clap my hands
"It is finished!" Jesus cries
Begone, unbelief,  My Savior is near
I will trust and not be afraid (Yoder)
Though I walk the shore that rims the ocean
I will trust in the Lord
Step by step I go upon life's journey
I may not see the reason for my tears
Iâ€™ve a Savior whom I love and fain would please
I will wait upon the Lord, For from Him all blessings come
I will wait upon the Lord
I believe in God
I will walk in the presence of the Lord
I will walk in the presence of the Lord
I am traveling on to a City fair
I will wave my hands in praise and adoration
I wish I could sing, as angels can sing
I wish I might have seen my Lord
Life was filled with guns and wars
I wish you knew my Jesus 
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky
I wonder if thereâ€™s someone who can help me
O, I often sit and wonder of the friends who're over yonder
When I come to the gates of the city of God
I often pause and wonder why
I am here for a day to make brighter the way
I worship Thee, sweet Son of God
I worship thee, Lord Jesus
I worship wholly love's great power
I worship You, Almighty God
I worship you, O LORD
Earthly pleasures vainly call me
I would be Thine
I would be true, for there are those who trust me
Thou didst call me, dear Lord, when I wandered alone
I would not have a hand to guide
I would not have my way, dear Lord, but Thine
I would not live without Him if I could
I would see Jesus when the flowers
I would sing Thy love, my Saviour
I wrestle not now, but trample on sin
Dear Lord, I yield to Thee my heart
God of our land, our father's God, receive
[I'd Give You Water if I Could]
I should like to be living
In my memory there's a picture of my happy childhood home
On some morning when I stand in God's wonderful city
In this world I've tried most everything And I'm happy now to say
What joy of life abideth
If angels sung a Savior's birth
[If Anyone Is in Christ]
If birds that neither sow nor reap
If Christ had not been raised from death
[If Christ Is Charged with Madness]
If Christ is mine, then all is mine
I may live my life alone
If duty calls, and suffering, too
If God be for us
If God be on my side
[If God Does Not Build Up Our House]
If God does not build up the house
If God had not been on our side
[If God Has Chosen A Nation]
If God Himself be for me
If God Himself be for me
If God is for us, who can be against us?
If God is mine, then present things
Life is now slipping fast away
If God the LORD were not our constant help
If I can help somebody
[If I Can Speak]
If I come to Jesus
I would sing with gladness amid earth's toil and strife
If I Could Visit Bethlehem
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior
If I had been a shepherd, could I have seen his star
There will be no shining pathway
If I must die, O let me die, Trusting in Jesus' blood
If I speak a foreign tongue
[If I Spoke Every Tongue]
[If I Take the Wings of the Morning]
If I take the wings of the morning
If I today have grieved my Savior's heart
Hark! the Saviorâ€™s voice I hear
If I were a sunbeam, I know what I would do
If I were an astronaut out in space
The Lord Jesus, when he had eaten with his disciples
If I your Lord have washed your feet
If in the cause of right I must
If it's peace you long for, friends
It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide
If Jesus goes with me I'll go anywhere
We shall walk through the valley in peace
If Jesus leads the way for me
If Jesus rose not from the grave
From over the waters there comes a sad cry
If life is like a wedding feast
There are paths that I may walk
If my people called by my name
If My people who bear My name
If My people, which are called by My name
[If My People's Hearts Are Humbled]
If on my soul a trace of sin remaineth
If one could speak the very words of angels
If one each art possessed
If one poor sheep should go astray
"If only I had known the cost of human greed
If only I have Thee
Within the Father's house tonight
If our fathers want to go
If our first fathers in their love
If our God had only called us
Like the knight of old, in armor clad
I should like to die, said Willie
If Paul in Caesar's court must stand
If some disease has robbed you
He left the spendor of heaven
If the cross we boldly bear
What if the Master should come tonight
If the prophets lived, today, what would their warning be?
Jesus is a friend to all who will trust His love
If this be the last song we'll sing together
If thou but know the life that thou are leading
If thou hast the skill to reckon
If Thou, True Life, wilt in me live
If Thy beloved Son, O God
If to the hills I lift mine eyes
Sing joyful songs to the Lord!
[If today you hear his voice]
Come, sing your joy to the Lord
In God's Word it is recorded
If we all pull together, together, together
If we are the children of God
[If We Are Raised to Life in Christ]
If we claim to love our neighbor
[If We Confess Our Sins]
If we could speak all tongues of earth and heaven
If we have died to ourselves in Jesus
[If We Love One Another]
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
If we only seek peace
Jesus is the light that's shining on our way
There is work to do
If we will trust in God to guide us
If we're not the ones who do it
If ye then with Christ be risen
If you are a Christian you can happy be
[If You Are Encouraged]
If you are saved, go tell somebody else
He'll lift you up if you ask Him
If you believe and I believe and we together pray
[If You Bring Your Gift]
If you but trust in God to guide you
If you've started with God for His kingdom on high
If you knew the blessed Savior as I know Him
If you live right, heaven belongs to you
If you love me, truly love me
I suffer shame and insult because I know you well
If you love Me, I now say
If you say, "Go," we will go
There is One who promises to lead you
In your heart of hearts are you a trifle weary
If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy
If you want to go to heaven
When the days are sad and long, and it seems you've lost your song
You can make your life a blessing
If you would be a pillar in the church of God
If you would come after Me, to your self say no
If you would have new life
In our journey thro' this life we're sure to find
If the world and all of its wealth you gain
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
After all life's storms are ended and my trials here are o'er
Since my Redeemer said "Come unto Me"
When the sun of life is setting, and my work on earth is done
I'll be a sunbeam for Jesus
when I get to Heaven in that happy land above
Way over yonder by the river a mansion waits for me
We will soon be at home in that beautiful land
As thru this world I sadly roam
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Christ the blessed Lord has promised to prepare a dwelling place
When I see the King, of Whose love I sing
Here I travel a rough thorny road
When this life is ended and I cross the chilly tide
As a pilgrim and a stranger I must travel below
Some sweet day I shall be moving, when my life work is ended
Soon I am going where people never tire
When I get to heaven some sweet day
Some one must cross o'er the ocean wild
When the mighty tribulations are poured out upon the earth
Jesus is coming to claim His own
Jesus is coming back to earth to claim His own
On that morrow
When to heaven I go from this world below
When I see the Dove that I love up above
When all my trials and cares are o'er
Will your heart be crush'd with sorrow
I am just a weary pilgrim passing thru this world of care
If you miss me singing down here
When He calls me, I will answer
I'll be with him by and by
I'll be there, I'll be there
Oft I've heard my mother tell Of a home she loved so well
When the trump of God shall sound and the saints shall leave the ground
There's a land of bliss eternal
I have started out to walk in the light
When the shadows slowly gather
I longed to be a child of God
I'm only a pilgrim down here, I'm seeking a country somewhere
The sun of my life now is sinking
Ev'ry morning on its wings
I'll see my Savior face to face
I'll cling closer to Jesus
I'll dearly love thee, Lord, my strength
There's many a trouble comes to me, there's many a cross to bear
Some glad morning when this life is o'er
When I see the mighty King descending in His royal majesty
I'll fly away, some glory day
On some morning bright and fair
I'll follow Jesus
Weary here, but I must move along
The future lies unseen ahead,
When I shall come to the river
The heavens are lowering overcast
I love my blessed Savior, from sin He set me free
I'll gladly suffer for Jesus
I'll go in the strength of the Lord
Once I was lost on the highway
Just beyond the river, in the sweet forever, is a happy land of bright sunshine
The stroke of God for my sins fell
My Savior needs helpers from day to day
It may not be on the mountain's height
Jesus Saviour, how I love Thee, there's no other friend so true
God's angel of death has numbered my days
I'm pressing along to heaven my goal
On the resurrection morning when all the dead in Christ shall rise
I'll hear what God the Lord will speak
When thorny is my pathway and steep the road
I'll pray while the sun is shining
Unto Thee, O Lord, I'll render praise with my whole heart
I'll keep traveling along, ever singing a song
Since I've trusted in the Savior, found His matchless grace and favor
Soon I'll leave this old world, with its trouble and woe
Oh the time will come and it won't be long
I'll live for Jesus day after day
I have read about a place that's filled with jewels rare
When comes the judgment morning
Jesus said I am the way to that land of endless day
So often I've heard of the Saviour who came from His heaven above
I'm trusting each day in Jesus my guide
I was deep in sin and trouble within
Over on the bright elysian shore
I'll meet you in Heaven, that wonderful place
On earth there is suf'ring and sorrow
I will meet you in the morning by the bright river side
I like to hear you say, keep striving ev'ry day
Tho' I bear a burden and carry here a cross
It was a time of sweetest peace
He gave me a voice but He left me the choice
Like Abraham from the plains of sin
There's a beautiful home in the land of the blest
I have started for a city in a land of fadeless day
When the saints of God are gathered to the home above
I'm just a weary pilgrim, a pilgrim worn and weary
As thru this world and its sorrow
I'll of salvation take the cup
This world is one great battlefield
While trav'ling down life's rugged way
Here my stay is transient, I am only passing through
I will ride God's plane to my sweet home above
On a cloud I'll ride to glory, in the morning, by and by
There is glory awaiting yonder
Going up yonder, never to wander, gonna meet my Lord and King
On that great resurrection, when I hear the trumpet sound
I'm treading the narrow pathway that  leads to glory land
Each day I trust my blessed Redeemer
When I see Jesus coming down from above
When I reach that beautiful country, over on the evergreen shore
Some day I'll see my Savior's face
I'm just a weary stranger in this old world below
My Savior found me one day and rolled my burdens away
I'll shout the name of Christ who lives
[I'll Sing a New Hymn To My God]
Gladly I sing of love divine
The Saviour is my Lord and King
For Jesus Christ my Savior
My pathway home is shining bright
Someday I'll sing His praise in Glory
Someday I'm going to heaven I know
On that happy, glad tomorrow, when I'm thru with pain and sorrow
This world holds nothing for me, I've left its follies behind
As I travel day by day in the straight and narrow way
My evening sun is low
There's a sweet and lovely picture in my mind I see tonight
There is a place of joy complete
I oft take a trip to scenes of my childhood
After my story I shall have glory in a wonderful land
Many are the doubters of God's word divine
So many people ride today in autos, trains and ships
Nothing to say for Jesus
I'll tell it all to Jesus, my troubles I cannot bear
Iâ€™ll tell to all that God is love
I'll Thee exalt, my God O King
I'll thee extol, my God, and King
I'll thee extol, O Lord, on high
I'll try again, I'll try again
I'm exhausted tryin' to figure out which way my life should go
While walking on the glory highway Jesus fills me with a song
Sing the blessed story of redeeming grace
I'll wash my hands in innocence
When my soul shall reach the glory land
I'm only a pilgrim here below
When the evening falls and my Saviour calls
By and by, when I look on his face
It is sweet indeed to know, in this pilgrim land below
When the mighty trump of God is sounding
When my little visit here is ended and I hear the home-bells chime
When shall end this life, with its toil and strife
On some happy morning bright and fair, when I meet Jesus in the air
I'm a happy pilgrim on my way
I'm a little pilgrim, Here I may not stay
I'm a little teapot, short and stout
Once I was a lonely stranger, drifting down the stream of danger
I have no abiding place while I run this earthly race
I'm a pilgrim here in a world of sorrow, trouble and woe
I'm a pilgrim in the valley
O brothers, won't you help me
A soldier in the army of the King of kings am I
I'm a soldier bound for glory
I'm a soldier, let me ride
I'm abiding today in Canaan land
I'm accepted, I'm forgiven
I'm acquainted with the Author
O Blessed, blessed Bible
I am adopted; I'm a child of the King
I'm an heir of God, and a joint heir with Jesus
Many the time I am torn with disappointment
I am anchored in my Saviour's
My Master will some day take me to a beautiful home beyond the blue
I'm believing and receiving
I'm believing Thee now, Lord
I'm black, I'm white, I'm short, I'm tall
I'm bound for heaven, Goodbye to sin
Tho' often at me fiery darts may be hurled
While here I am only a pilgrim
The blessed Sunlight from heaven sweetly is flooding my soul
As I go winding my journey thru this world of sin and woe
I've wandered so long in sin's dark way
I'm confident of this very thing
My Lord and Savior went to Calvary
I'm determined to walk with Jesus, yes, I am
As I journey on life's road, often tired with heavy load
For years my soul was hungry and longed for living bread
I'm enlisted on the road
I'm Esther the Purim Queen
I am feeding on the living bread
I'm finding sweet pleasure, true joy without measure
Since I now have full salvation, I will tell to ev'ry nation
You did not wait for me to draw near to You
Long ago Jesus came, He took all my shame
God in his mercy calls unto [upon] me
The loving Father promised to hear me when I pray
Oh, I am getting ready for that meeting over on the golden shore
The Savior left His home above and came to earth
I once was lost in Egypt's land, was sinking on the desert sand
In my heart today the bells of gladness ring
If all church people were Christians, with God's love down in each heart
[I'm Glad I'm One of Them]
I once was sad and all alone
When the billows round me roll, my Savior draweth near
On the cross of Calvary, Jesus died to set me free
I'm so glad that God is able to relieve us of our care
When I was struggling on the dark mountain
I would still be lost in sin with no peace and joy within
I'll honor Christ the Lord while here below
I've found the pearl of priceless worth, renounced the things of earth
Far out beyond the shores of time there is a bright and sunny clime
I am walking in the light, in the path that's always bright
When I have anchored over in Glory land
Oh! the road to Calvary is rough and steep
I'm going higher, yes higher someday
There's a land beyond the shadows and by faith I see
When my work on earth is done, I'm going home
While going thru this world of sorrow
When our work on earth is ended, by the shining hosts attended
O what a happy day, when cares no more dismay
In my Father's home in glory
I'm going home to glory-land
There is a home awaiting the faithful and the true
My heavenly home is bright and fair
I travel down this road a stranger
For the Lord I'll labor here, tell His love both far and near
What if some times the road is dusty, over mountains rough and wild?
I mean to go right on Until the crown is won;
I've started out to walk the straight and narrow way
I've found the straight and narrow way
I'm going on a honey moon with Jesus some sweet day
I'm going on a journey
I'm on the way the holy prophets went
I am traveling in the pathway, which our fathers trod
There's a stream, mystic stream flowing deep, flowing wide
Iâ€™ve heard of a land of joy and peace
I read of heaven far away
There is a land where falls no tears
Just beyond the silent sea
Since I began to serve the Lord
Just beyond the earthly shadows
When life here is o'er
When I shall leave these troubles below
If religion was a thing that money could buy
I'm going to my home eternal
To a better country I am going some day
There is a happy land of promise just across Jordan's rolling tide
I'm going up, up, up
I'm gonna click, click, click
On some glad wonderful morning
When my mind gets tired and weary
I'm gonna keep on singing
I'm gonna live so God can use me
I'm gonna march if the spirit says "March."
I'm going thru, yes, I'm going thru
Jesus the King is coming from heaven, coming to take His faithful ones home
When Gabriel sounds his silver trumpet and the saints of earth arise
Soon I'll catch a cloud and rise
I'm gonna soar away to glory
Jesus left His throne in the sky
I'm gonna say goodby and go beyond the sky
I'm gonna see my Lord in the morning
When traveling days are over, I'm gonna leave this place
I'm a weary pilgrim on my way to glory land
I'm gonna shout, shout, shout out my love for Jesus
When I get to heaven, I'm gonna sing
While I'm treading this path of sorrow I am waiting for His glad call
I'm gonna sing when the Spirit says sing
On some wonderful happy morning
I'm gonna work and watch and pray
I'm happy, shouting and singing, praising heaven's King
I have been with Jesus, blessed be his name
Since Jesus made my heart his home
Since I gave my life to Jesus the Savior, trusting Him for life and light
My soul is happy on the way
Since Jesus came along and set the sun to shining, lighting up the way to heaven's goal
I love the name of Jesus, â€™tis precious to repeat
I'm happy, so happy in Jesus today
When my Saviour came to me, and from sin He set me free
I'm happy now my sins are gone
I'm happy singing with joy bells ringing
There's nothing so precious as Jesus to me
Mid sorrow and strife of this wearisome life
I'll lift up my head and rejoicing I'll sing
My Saviour died on Calvary
His grace is as high as a mountain
I'm trav'ling thro' this world of sin each day
I'm walking with my Lord along this pilgrim way
What great joy is in my soul, since the Savior made me whole
I may never march in the infantry
Hello, I'm just a stranger
I'm keeping the promise to Jesus my King
You better mind, my sister, how you walk on the cross
Egypt was once my home, I was a slave
Once I wandered in the darkness
He did not come to spare me all the woes of life
I'm living my life for Jesus
I've left Egypt and its sin behind me
I'm looking away beyond this desert land
Brother I'm looking for a crossing, ever this dark cold stream of death
This old world is reeling and rocking, sin is raging everywhere
I'm looking for the morning of life's eternal day
I'm marching, marching on my trail
When the Lord shall come to take me home
I'm happy to know as onward I go
I am moving toward that city over in glory land
I heard about a country beyond the mystic sea
I'm going to move right up to heaven some day
I'm nearer to the land of joy and peace
I'm nearing my home where I'll never roam
I'm happy today along on my way
I'm nearing the gates of the city, Yon city so bright and so fair
I'm a pilgrim, I'm a stranger, Through a strange land
I found free grace and dying love
Perfect joy is mine today since I found the living way
I'm not ashamed to own my Lord
I'm not your judge, Nay! God forbids
My feet are weary, but I am going
Iâ€™m on my way unto the home
I am on my way to Canaan's land
I'm on the upward track, and naught can turn me back
There's a home on the other side, where with the Lord I shall abide
I'm on my way to glory land, with Jesus who loves me so
I'm on my way to heaven's land Where angels sing upon the strand
In the light of my Redeemer, I am glad that I can say
I am on the shining way to the land of endless day
Once my life was lost but Jesus paid the cost
I've left the sinful, rugged byway
I'm on the road to heaven
I'm on the rock, Hallelujah
O I'm living on the victory side
I'm on the vict'ry side
I'm glad I have salvation down in my soul today
Along the way of life are many foes
Long the paths of sin my wayward feet have trod
Oh, so often I think of heaven so fair
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed,
I'm redeemed, Lord help me tell it
I am happy each day as I travel life's way
I'm redeemed, yes I am
I'm resting, calmly resting
I am sailing for lands afar, going to gates that stand ajar
There is a mansion up in glory that is free from sin and pain
For many years I traveled out on sin's mountain cold
If my blessed Lord is my guide
I have escaped the burning sand
In my heart I have a story
In this old world of sin and woe
When I was wand'ring in sin, the Savior came in
I'm satisfied with Jesus here
I'm saved, saved, saved
I'm saved through the blood
I've started on a journey
Shouting hallelujah as I travel
I'm singing a glory song all day long
I've found a friend in Jesus who fills my ev'ry need
I'm singing praises
I'm singing your praise, Lord
Got to go to judgment, O, yes!
I'm so glad that a wonderful Saviour
There is joy within my heart, I can't explain
In this troublesome land I must have help to stand
I'm so glad that Jesus paid the penalty
On my journey I am singing
I'm so glad the loving Savior came to die for you and me
I'm so glad I'm saved
I'm so glad Jesus lifted me
I've a Saviour in the glory
I'm so glad troubles don't last always
When my friends and my foes turn against me
I'm so happy! I'm so happy
I'm special because God has loved me
There is a beautiful city waiting yonder above
In sin I wandered, talents I squandered
No more my own, Lord Jesus
I'm a weary pilgrim here below, in a world of sorrow, sin and woe
Since Jesus my Lord found me and put His arms of love around me
I'm traveling on, to a city supernal
I'm traveling on with Jesus my King
I am trusting ev'ry day on this lonesome pilgrim way
I'm waiting by the river side
I'm waiting for the Lord to come
I'm happy each day while trav'ling this way
Now, brother, I am confessing that I've wandered in paths of sin
I have a happy song of praise each day
I'm walking with my Savior, I'm walking day by day
I'm walking with my Saviour, who took my place on Calvary
Down deep in my soul a melody rings
My life and my love I leave in Your hands
Immaculate Mary, your praises we sing
Thou King of earth and sea and sky
O Thou, my feeble voice and heart inspire
Arise, and hail the sacred day
Hallelujah, ein Sohn ist geboren
Immanuel, O Immanuel
O sing me that song again, Whose charm doth
Sometimes our load is heavy and the teardrops bedim our way
Immanuel! to Thee we sing
Immanuel, to Thee we sing 
Immanuel, to you we sing
In this place, with God's word
Immortal Babe, who this dear day
Immortal honors rest on Jesus' head
Immortal, invisible, God only wise
Immortal Love, for ever full
Great Former of this various frame
In a feedbox, in a stable
In a garden, God blessed creation
In a garden, man was placed
There's a mansion built above
In a land of strange delight
I'm so glad I've found a hiding place
In Adam we have all been one
In all my ways, in every task
In all our grief and fear we turn to you
And this we know in the journey of life
And in all things give Him thanks
[In All Things God Works for the Good]
In all thy glorious ways, O God
In all thy ways acknowledge Him, Acknowledge Him, acknowledge Him
In all thy ways, O God
In an age of twisted values
In anguish Jesus prayed alone
In anguished grief, groan men divided all
In atmosphere of love divine
In Bethlehem a babe was born
[In Bethlehem a Newborn Boy]
In Bethlehem is He born
In Bethlem town the Christ was born
I'm dwelling now upon the heights
In bondage to the Law
In boundless mercy, gracious Lord, appear
In Cana at a wedding feast
In celebrating love divine
In Christ alone my hope is found
In Christ called to baptize, we witness to grace
I know in whom I put my trust
In Christ is blessedness
In Christ is brotherhood alone
In Christ my Saviour's wounds secure
[In Christ, Our Faith]
Welcome, all you noble saints of old
In Christ there is no east or west
In Christ there is no east or west

In conflict, turmoil, war, and strife
When that the Lord
IN days long past the mercy seat
[In Days of Old On Sinai]
In de dark woods, no Indian nigh
In Death's strong grasp the Saviour lay
[In deep distress]
In deepest night, in darkest days
In deepest night we hear the story
In deepest night when all was still
I trust in God, how dare ye then
In doubt and temptation I rest, Lord, in Thee
In Egypt under Pharaoh the Israelites were bound
In essentials let us be united
By grace we grasp a thread of hope
In every land begin the song
[In Everything Give Thanks]
Give thanks in the night of thy sorrow
In evil long I took delight
In exile here we wander
When Israel by God's addresse
Christ, our star, our map, our road
In fancy we picture that beautiful land
In full and glad surrender
In full assurance of Thy grace
Though the night be dark and dreary, Though the heart be faint and weary (Davis)
What a joy 'twill be in glory
There's a land beyond the river, Where all is peace and love
In God alone my soul can find rest and peace
Then I saw a new earth, a new heaven
In God, my faithful God
In God, my Savior, I put my trust alone
In God the Father I believe
[In God the Father's Plan]
In God, the Lord most just
In God we trust, with all our heart and soul
In God we Trust
In God will I trust, though my counselors say
In God's name let us on our way!
[In God's Own Time]
On some sweet day, in time to come
In God's time, peace will come
In grateful songs your voices raise
In great thanksgiving, O Love Divine
In grief and aching sorrow
In grief and fear, to thee, O Lord
In Haiti, there is anguish that seems too much to bear
In haste, O God, attend my call
Sometimes I grow weary
In heaven above, in heaven above
In heaven, in heaven
In heav'n is joy and gladness
In Heavenly Love abiding
In her Lord His Church rejoices
Out in the highways and hedges today
In Him, In Him
Sinking from self into Jesus
In him abiding, my all confiding
In Jesus I find great salvation
[In Him We Live]
In Him we live and move
Tho the cross be pressing deeply
I would know Him who keeps me, would follow always
Tell me why, O Christian soldier
Why should you be weary
Happy all the time
Let me walk in the path which my Savior hath trod,
In His name and for His glory
Men of Zion, for the Master living
In His own raiment clad
In his pavilion hiding
[In His Presence]
In His presence there is comfort
Not built with hands is that fair radiant chamber
In Godâ€™s temple a blessing waits
In His temple now behold Him
Oh, let thy fear be on my heart
In holy conversation
In holy reverence, Lord, we come
In holy waiting we're at home
In hope my soul redeemed to bliss unending
In hope of heav'n I find relief
In house and home where man and wife
In hymns of praise will I employ my tongue
To all that now in Jewry dwell
In Jesus I find rest and peace

In loftiest strains address the mighty God
In loftiest strains our sov'reign Lord adore
In loftiest strains the great eternal praise
In lonely mountain ways
In loud exalted strains
Come, come! weary one, come
May love be our home; rest to soothe tired bones
In love you summon, in love I follow
In loving adoration
[In loving partnership]
In loving remembrance we honor the grave
In lowering gloom and cloudiness
In Matthew's gospel there are five
Thou, O Christ, my Lord and King
In me resume thy dwelling
[In Memory of Her]
In mercy, not in wrath, Rebuke me, gracious God!
In midnight's stillness
In mine own Flesh I see
We come from the mountains, the valleys and plains
In moments like these, I sing out a song
This world is filled with dangers, fashions so new
In this world here below I've no wealth nor treasure
All day long I am under attack
In my distress I cry to God
[In My Distress I Sought the Lord]
In my Distress, to God, I cry'd
There'll be no sorrow there, In my Father's house
In my Father's house are many mansions
In my grievous tribulation
In my heart the Savior lives
I have a song that Jesus gave me
When my work on earth is done
[In My Hour of Grief Or Need]
In my need Jesus found me
In our darkness light has shone
In our darkness there is no darkness with you, O Lord
In our day of thanksgiving one psalm let us offer
In our dear Lord's garden
In our end is our beginning
In our hearts celestial voices
In our households, heavenly Father
In our work and in our play, Jesus, be thou ever near
In patient faith, till Christ shall come
In peace and joy I now depart
In peace and joy I now depart
In peace and joy I now depart
In peace and joy I now depart
In peace, let us pray to the Lord
O most high and glorious God
In pilgrim life our rest
In pity to a dying world
In praise of God meet duty and delight
Sun and moon, bless the Lord!
In prayer your voices raise ye
[In Remembrance of Me]
Jesus, hope for all
In righteous glory reigning
In righteousness stand firm
In seasons of grief to my God
I sat alone with life's memories
In silence my soul is waiting
In silent pain the eternal Son
In silver light of early morning
In Sion's sacred fane the joyous lay
In solitude, in solitude
O Mighty God! When I thy works consider
In songs of sublime adoration and praise
In speechless prayer and reverence
In spirit when I took my flight
In star and crescent, wheel and flame
We press along and sing a song
In strains before unsung, in noblest lays
In suffering love the thread of life
In sweet communion, Lord, with you
In tenderness He sought me
Infant of days, yet Lord of Life
In thanks we lift our hearts to Thee
From the first bright light of morning 
When our troubles are over, at the clods of the day
Some blessed morning, some happy day
I'm going home, no more to roam
Jesus came from on high, suffered that you and I
There's a better day a comin' fare ye well, fare ye well
There's a home of wondrous beauty for the saved by grace
In that land of bliss where holy angels dwell
There is a land of joy divine beyond the rolling tide
[In that Land Which We Call Holy]
In that peaceful home in glory
In the Advent light, O Savior
Here at times we are so happy that our hearts beat high with joy
The Lord of life is the Shepherd
I am in the army of my Saviour, fighting here to win His blessed favor
In the Army ranks are we
In the battle of right against the wrong
How green is the hillside; how fresh is each tree
Come let us worship the Lord
In the beginning the whole world was gloomy
[In the beginning: God]
In the beginning God played with the planets
In the beginning, God said Be
In the beginning was the Word eternal
In the bleak midwinter
Children, would you know the story
In the bliss of old predicted
In the bonds of Death He lay
When the storm is wildly raging over our frail and helpless bark
As we walk the dusty road (As we gather on this day)
In the walking on the road, we saw him
In the church are many strangers
In the circle of each home
Listen to my story
Oh, have you not heard of that wonderful City
Hallelujahs ever ring
In the cleansÃ¨d temple
High as the mountain though the billows roll
In the country nigh to Bethlehem
Life is but a page in the great book of time
In the cross of Christ I glory
Receive the sign of the cross on your ears
In the dark and silent night,Blessed Lord, be Thou my light
In the dark of early morn
[In the Dark of Easter Morning]
In the darkest valley
In the darkness, blinding groping
In the darkness of Gethsemane
In the darkness of the morning
In the darkness of the still night
Though we journey the pathway that leads through the night
In the dawn of the morn
In the day of need may your answer be the LORD
In the day of sore affliction
In the days now cold and darkened
In the days of early childhood
In the days of my youth I will love Him
I will cast in the depths of the fathomless sea
In the desert, on God's mountian
In the early morning
In the East is morning breaking
In the end, where will we be?
Jesus said to his disciples That they should not troubled be
We're thankful for the family--the family of God
In the Father's glory shining
In the fields near Bethlehem
In the floods of tribulation
I come to the garden alone
When mine eyes are dim with weeping
There's a lovely garden blooming for me
In the gloaming, oh, my darling! when the lights are dim and low
There is a city bright and fair, In the glory land
Angel choirs are singing with their many millions strong
When the Savior said to me one day, O won't you come along
Singing a happy song of praise to Christ our King
Brighter grows His love to me
There's a joyful chorus sounding
In the hallowed manger
Sailor, on life's stormy ocean
There's a land where sorrow never will be knonw
In the heavens shone a star
In the heavens the Lord Almighty
In the hollow of His hand He will hide me
Tho' the tempest rages fiercely and the billows madly dash
There are many precious moments
In the hour of trial
I was glad when they said
In the land beyond the storm clouds
With the hallelujah band, I am in the promised land
What a glad, happy day at the end of the way
On some wonderful day I shall go far away
It is summer all over the meadows
In the light from above
Along a dark and gloomy path
Listen to the glad soldiers working
There will dawn a glorious morning
[In the Lord My Heart Is Strong]
In the Lord's atoning grief
In the Lord's own house shall I dwell
LIKE to a lamb who from the fold has strayed
In the midst of dreaming, warning
In the midst of earthly life
In the midst of life, behold
In the midst of new dimensions
When the day of life is ended
Some sweet day I'm going away, to my heavenly home
Sweetly I am thinking of a morning bright
When from my sight the last earth-shadow falls
In the morning hear my voice
In the morning I will raise
In the morning, O God, do I lift up mine eyes
In the morning of joy when the dead shall arise
There will come a glad time in a bright sunny clime
In the morning when I rise
[In the Name of Christ Rejoicing]
In the Name of Him who loves us 
In the name of Jesus
In the name of Jesus, Amen.
In the name of the Father
There is strength in the name of the Lord
In the name which earth and heaven
We're a pilgrim band now headed for the glory land of light
When the toils of life are over, And we lay our armor down
Our Father, we thank Thee for the sunrise each morn
I am going along in the pathway of love
Near, so very near to God
In the pleasant land of Heaven
In the power of God's own Spirit
In the presence of a holy God
In the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, Prince of Peace
In the presence of Jehovah
O, to be over yonder
When these eyes shall behold the King of glory
In the presence of the Saviour
In the presence of your people
In the quiet consecration
In the quiet of this moment there is joy
In the quiet of this place
In the quiet with God, I'm relieved of my burdens
In the ranks of the dear old Army
In the resurrection
Our Savior soon is coming, attended by a throng
In the Rock Iâ€™m safely resting
[In the Same Night]
There's a sweet and wonderful retreat
In the secret of HIs presence how my soul delights to hide!
In my heart there rings a song, as with joy I press along
When we tread the vale of sorrow
In the shadow of the cross, Side by side with bitter loss
With heart and soul, O Lord I give you thanks
In the silence of that night so bright
In the silent midnight watches
In the silent midnight watches
In the singing, in the silence
I want to meet Him in the sky
In the stillness of this hour
Christ is ever by my side, He's a true and faithful guide
In the streets of every city
There's a land of light and love
In the sunshine of his love, O how precious 'tis to be
How my heart with joy is thrilling
There's a land of great beauty where the saved ones all go
In the sweet bye and bye
There will be a happy day when my soul is called up home
Of this earthland I am weary
In the time of trouble God himself will hide thee
In the tomb they laid him
In the tomb so cold they laid Him
In the upper room at Jerusalem (Harris)
In the upper room, Jesus and his friends
It was down in the valley, and near the river side
In the valley of the shadow
In the very midst of life
In the vineyard of our Father
Into the waters of expiation
In the wilderness no wind blew
In the window where you can send your glow
In the wonder of creation
In the woods the young boy
In thee, all-clement God, my hopes I place
In thee, great God, with songs of praise
In thee I put my steadfast trust
In Thee I put my steadfast trust, Defend me, Lord, from shame
In thee, in thee confiding, dear Savior
In Thee is gladness
In Thee is gladness in every sadness
In thee, Lord Christ, is fixed my hope
In Thee, Lord, have I put my trust
In thee, O God, my constant trust I place
In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust
In Thee, O Lord, I place my Trust
In thee, O Lord, I place my Trust
In thee, O Lord, I put my trust
In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust
In their appointed days
We reach out to those who are homeless
In these days so chaotic and threatening
In Thine own good time, dear Lord, we trust
In this is love, that God loved us
In this night we hear rejoicing
In this our happy Christmastide
This is the place; now is the time
We are all hungry people
In this place of prayer and singing
In this place your Word is planted
In this very room there's quite enough love for one like me
In this world abound
In those days came John the Baptist
In Thy heart and hands, my God
In Thy Name, O Lord, assembling
When the tedious day of toil is done
In thy wrath and hot displeasure
Fear not the pathless wilderness
In time of tribulation
In times like these you need a Savior
In times of great decision, Be with us, God, we pray!
[In Token That Thou Shalt Not Fear]
Moment by moment, in touch with Thee
In triumph he went heavenward
In triumph, joy and holy fear
In triumph our Redeemer
In unity we lift our song
In vain, O man of lawless might
In vain perversely, princes, you surmise
In vain the giddy world inquires
In vain the powers of darkness try
In vain the preacher cried, Repent
In vain the Saviorâ€™s mightiest foes
In vain would boasting reason find
In vain ye woo me to your harmless joys
In vision to His saints God spake
In water we grow, secure in the womb
In which road do you travel, my brother?
In winter's grip, the earth lies cold
In yon blessed home where my Savior has gone
In you is gladness
In you is gladness
O Lord, my heart is not proud
In you, Lord, I have found my peace
In you, LORD, I take refuge
In you, my God, may my soul find its peace
[In You No Beauty]
[In You, O Lord, I Find My Refuge]
By your saving power deliver me
In you, O LORD, I put my trust
In you, O LORD, I put my trust
In you there is a refuge
In your arms, Lord Jesus Christ
In Your arms of love
In your goodness, O God
In your great love, answer me, O God
In your heritage the nations
In your light, we see light
Do not let me down
In your mercy, Lord, you called me
Incarnate God! what tongue can tell
In mute astonishment and awe
It was inch by inch that I sought the Lord
Incidental words are a powerful force
Lord bow thine ear to my request
Incline your ear, O Lord, to me 
Lord Jesu, when, when shall it be
So I say to you: "ask, you will receive
Increase our faith, almighty Lord!
I found another life to lead
Indeed, how good is the Lord
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea 
Indulgent Father, by whose care
Indulgent God, to thee we pray
Indulgent God, with pitying eye
Indulgent Sovereign of the skies
In the stable ('tis no fable) Mary bore her Baby small
Infant holy, infant lowly
Infinite excellence is thine
Informed people tend to live their lives responsibly
Ye warblers of the vernal shade
Injustice to you is injustice to me
Loved ones in glory are waiting for me
When I shall land inside the gate
What a happy time when we get to Heaven
O that my mortal eyes might see
Inspirer and hearer of prayer
Instruct me in Thy statutes, Lord
Where there is hatred, we will sow His love
Intelligence is a bouquet
In you, O Lord, is the source of life
Creator of the stars of night and of dawn's new rays
Strengthen all who hope in you
Lord, have mercy, Lord have mercy
Into a world of dark
Into my heart, into my heart
Come into my heart, blessed Jesus
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
Into our hearts, O Spirit, come
Into paradise may the angels lead you
Into the Dim Earth's Lowest Parts Descending
Into the hands that blessed the children
Upholding me, enfolding me
Out of the midnight into the morning
[Into the Temple]
Into thy gracious hands I fall
Kneeling before thee, Lord, I am praying
O God, my God, why have you gone from me
Give him/her eternal rest, O Lord
How great the sign of God's love for us
Come souls that long for Jesus
Sinner, hear the Savior's call
Sinners, obey the gospel word
O Lord, open our lips
May the rain fall softly on you
Is anyone thirsty? 
Is every time a threshold time?
Is God for me, what is it
Is God withdrawing, all the cost
Is the Saviour preparing a mansion for you
Jesus is my Friend so true
I am not blessed with riches
Brother, sister, and friend, are you pardoned from sin?
Is it indeed too late, too late
Oh, the understanding love
Is it nothing to thee, is it nothing to thee
Our blessed Redeemer is passing this way
Is it nothing to you that a Saviour has died
Is it nothing to you that one day Jesus came
Jesus may come today
Is it well with your soul today, brother?
Is my name written there
Is summer ended, harvest past
When you sought for pardon and the burden rolled away
Are you working for the Lord
As you're going along o'er the rugged road
By faith I look beyond the swelling stream
Is there a lone and dreary hour
Is there a world of bitter woe
Is there any reason, sinner
He was born just a babe in Bethlehem
This world's a wilderness of woe
Is this the Church of our God?
Is this the day that gave me birth?
[Is This the World Where Giving Sight]
Is thy heart athirst to know
Have thy affections been nailed to the cross?
You have longed for sweet peace,
Once within your heart there burned a flame, a flame of holy love
Is your pathway clear as you onward tread
Is your path dark as night
Isaac was ransom'd when he lay
Rulers of Sodom! hear the voice
God indeed is my Savior
Truly, God is my salvation
Truly, God is my salvation
Behold! the mountain of the Lord
How glorious Sion's courts appear
Attend, ye tribes that dwell remote
I will sing to the Lord all the days of my life
I said: So I must go away
Why pour'st thou forth thine anxious plaint
Behold my Servant! see him rise
I will never forget you, my people
Ye heav'ns send forth your song of praise!
How few receive with cordial faith
Ho! ye that thirst, approach the spring
Thus speaks the high and lofty One
Attend, and mark the solemn fast
The race that long in darkness pined
Isaiah gave the promise
Isaiah in a vision did of old
Isaiah, mighty seer, in days of old
Isaiah, mighty seer, in spirit soared
Isaiah the prophet has written of old
[Island Dwellers, Hear My Story]
Isn't He beautiful?
Isn't He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!
Isn't it good to be together
Isn't it grand to be a Christian
Isn't it grand to be a Christian, isn't is grand?
There will never be a sweeter story
Israel, thy tribute bring to God's victorious name
Israel, trust thou in the Lord
Israel's Shepherd, guide me, feed me
[Israel's Shepherd, Hear Our Prayer]
It came upon the midnight clear
How great is the kindness of Jesus our King
It does not cost too hard a strife
It fell upon a summer day
It happened on that fateful night
It is a comely thing
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord
It is a thing most wonderful
I can see the sun creeping oer the hill
Life was but shadows and sadness and care
As you journey on life's way, burdened with a heavy load
It is enough with His Word to comply
"It is finished!" Christ hath known
Nothing either great or small, Nothing sinner, no
"It is finished," so the Saviour said
"It is finished"--all the pain
Long ago I saw my Savior
"It is finished," said Jesus, my Savior
Sweeter sing the birds today
It is glory just to walk with Him whose blood has ransomed me
It is God who holds the nations in the hollow of his hand
[It Is Good]
[It Is Good]
Let me dwell on Golgotha
Here, behold the seat of mercy
[It Is Good to Give Thanks]
It is good to give thanks to you, Lord
It is good to praise thâ€™ Almighty
It is good to sing your praises
Art thou weak in faith, and doubting
Lonely pilgrim, art thou weary
Fear not ye trembling saints
In the darkness, tempest tossed
Somebody comes and takes away
This is the song we sing, this is the news we bring
On a hill lone and gray stood an old rugged cross
All the darkness of the night has passed away
It is morning, it is morning in my heart
It is no longer I that liveth
The chimes of time ring out the news
It is no secret what God can do
It is not death to die
It is not enough to know God is good
It is not lost what I have given
[It Is So Good to Give Thanks and Praises to the Lord]
'Tis sweet to walk with the Saviour ev'ry hour of the day
It is the Holy Spirit's day
It is the Lord who died for me
It is the Lord! Behold His hand
When earthly cares I know no more
It is Thy blood, my Jesus
It is time! Let the white poppies bloom
It is to You I give the glory
He pardoned my transgressions,
It is very good to be
Do you hear, O fainting soldier
Grander earth has quaked before
I am living in the sunshine of my great Redeemer's love
It is wonderful to know that Jesus tho't of you and me
Is your heart oppressed? Do you long for rest?
Do you seek from sin a pardon
I feel love's showers falling, cheering my soul
If it be his will, I shall be satisfied
It looks like my Redeemer's come
Since the Savior took control, put this glory in my soul
I hear a mighty chorus sweetly singing over on that bright, eternal shore
It makes no difference who we are
Although He has millions of souls to see about
It may be a brother with whom I did play
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
The world sweeps on, its crush and din
As I travel thru this land, to the home above
On pleasure bent your days are spent
Hearken today to the blest invitation
It passes knowledge, that dear love of thine
It pays to be faithful to Jesus
When the sun goes down in the evening
It seems inhuman, who could kill
There is joy in my soul, I am happy and whole
Amid the shadows of life I wend my way
It shall be now; Lord, from my heart I say it
It shocked them that the master did not fast
Oh, it surely will be lovely in the morning
It takes his hand to grow your garden
My Father is omnipotent
It was a cross, the cruel bed they made him
When the sky turned black and Jesus cried
[It Was a Time of Miracles]
Once my soul was lost in sin, And I had no peace within
The Lord of earth and sea and sky
Why leave a heav'nly mansion?
In the temple, in the temple
When my soul was lost in darkness and I groped along in sin
It was love yes love true love from God above
[It Was No Empty Dreamer]
It was not peace I came to bring
[It Was On Sunday Morning]
It was poor little Jesus, yes, yes
It will be a happy day
It will be a happy landing
When my life on earth shall end and to heaven I ascend
There is a heavenly Country so bright
When for us our earthly race is ended
When we reach Heaven, that sweet home of the soul
Some morning the saved of every land shall gather upon the golden strand
When my life down here is o'er
There's a promised land made for all the free
It will be worth it all when we see Jesus
Some day I'm going away to glory, I am going to my reward
On some morning bright and fair, Jesus is coming in the air
There is struggle and strife in the battle of life
I'm going to a better country
If you look 'tward home as Moses did
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel old world we're living in
I am so glad I heard my Savior gently pleading
It's a grand thing to be a Christian
It's a grand thing to be saved!
I want to be like Jesus, be pure
Brother, as along life's way you go
We read in His Word that Jesus is coming
It's a song of praise to the Maker
God has promised to love us, He sent His only Son
It's all different now
I want my friends to pray that I
When it gets dark and I can't see my way
Press on ye soldiers of the cross
My day of life has just begun
Jesus walked the road to Calv'ry
It's good to thank the LORD
It's great to know some things by heart
There is a rest in ev'ry woe
Though some may sing to pass the weary night along
My soul is living in sunlight, and I'm going along
There is something that keeps me glad
There is a love, a matchless love
It's not imagination, I'm walking with the Lord
It's rising up from coast to coast
It's rounded like an orange
It's said that life is with danger fraught
Onward, upward, let us go
It's wonderful to walk with Jesus
It's Your blood that cleanses me
I've a Friend who will never leave me
I've a Friend who is true when the day is fair
Listen, O listen! I hear Him calling my name
I've a mansion bright and fair in the city built on high
'Neath a cloud of darkness and sorrow
I've no sure abiding place
I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest
I've been 'buked an' I've been scorned
Brother, when I get to heaven I shall sing and shout
I've been lifted out of the miry clay
I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
All glory to Jesus, the risen Lord
There's a song of gladness in my soul today
Oh! Lord I'm happy since you found me
Only those few words of greeting
To the promise of Christ I'm clinging
Some folk would rather have houses and land
Mankind is searching every day
When I was deep in sorrow, all burdened down with sin
O Lord, I've done what you told me to do
[I've Eaten Honey from the Comb]
I am fighting in the army of the Lord,
I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!
I've found a hiding place, wonderful hiding place
I've found a loving Savior
My soul had long been seeking peace and rest
Before I met my Saviour, my heart was troubled sore
I wandered in the darkness and my heart had lost its song
Once I was lost and living for Satan, under sin's heavy load
I've found the pearl of greatest price!
When I was wand'ring in sin I had no comfort within
I have found true joy in the Lord, there is peace in trusting His word
I've got a feeling
Just a few more miles to travel
I've got a new home in that Rock, don't you see?
Since I have been redeemed from sin
When trouble is in my way
I've got peace like a river
I'm glad Jesus came, glory to his name
I've got the Lord and the Lord's got me
I came to Jesus my Savior and He lifted my load
Weary of roaming around
Gone is my love for the pleasures of sin
I'm only a pilgrim and a stranger trav'ling thru this weary land below
O brother, do you love Jesus?
Blue blue all the time I used to worry a lot
In my heart a song of praise is ringing today
I found the living Savior, and cleansing from my sin
I've wandered in the valley where evil hid the light
I've listed in the holy war
I've moved, I've moved over into Canaan's land
I've never known a sinner and I doubt I ever will
Since Jesus came and found me and put his arms around me
O'er life's dark and stormy waters
I've pitched my tent t'wards the promised land
Dear Lord I've purposed in my heart, like Daniel did of old
In faith she touched the hem of his garment
Through all the long and lonely years
Dear friends, I have a story to tell
I've wandered in the darkness long enough
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
It is enough, old Jacob said
Jacob sought his rest at night
Jacobâ€™s star is risâ€™n at last

Jesus calls you to salvation
I was weary and my heart was full of care
Jesus came bringing us hope
Jesus came down from his glory, Just to redeem my lost soul
Jesus came from heaven above. Bringing pardon, peace and love
Jesus came into the world as a little babe
Jesus came, the heavens adoring
Jesus came to earth from glory
I was lost on sin's dark mountain, knew not where to go
Jesus came to the world for the sinner
By the burden of sin opprest
Oh, how sweet the blessed story

All I need to know of heaven is that Jesus will be there
Though the night may be dark, and the pathway may be drear

Naught have I to dread in the path ahead
When things go wrong just press right along

Jesus, Your Name is far above every name, I know
Naked as from the earth we came
Few are thy days, and full of woe
Who can resist th' Almighty arm
How still and peaceful is the grave!
Though trouble springs not from the dust
The rush may rise where waters flow
How should the sons of Adam's race
Let not your hearts with anxious thoughts
You now must hear my voice no more
Behold the Saviour on the cross
As when the Hebrew prophet raised
John three sixteen says that God so loved the world
John Barleycorn thinks he is great
John saw a white City to earth coming down
John saw the Heav'n and earth made new
I love to tell the story, How Christ, the King of glory
For God so loved the world, He gave His only Son
Join all thy powers, O my soul
Join all ye joyful nations
Wake, O people; sleep no longer
There's a song of joy that clearly comes
Let us join the happy song
Joined to Christ in mystic union
Joining our voices
God spoke to Jonah and gave him command
There was once a man of old, in the Scriptures, we are told
In my trouble, in my trouble
Over the mystical river today
Would your heart be free from sin
If the love of Jesus abides in my soul

As I journey along the upward way
Joy and triumph everlasting
Joy because the circling year
When I see the blessings strewn upon my way
Don't you hear the joy-bells, ringing sweet and clear
Once the blessed Lord who came from glory
When we cross the silent river to a land beyond the sky
Once I was weary, and all was dreary
Weeping may come
Blessed words of comfort in a time of grief
Though it seems others have more gladness
Joy fills our inmost hearts today!
Joy fills the dwelling of the just
Joy is waiting me yonder, sweet the tho't that I ponder
My heart sings an anthem of joy
Joy has dawned upon the world
There's joy in following Jesus all the way
I may not have of earthly store
There is joy in the love of my Savior above
If you would know the joy of living
We are in the service of the blessed Master
There is joy in serving Jesus, As I journey on my way
Is your life so filled with sorrow
I've found a joy in sorrow
I am rejoicing as on I go
There'll be joy in the morning on that day
From His tender love and mercy often did I stray
Joy! Joy! Joy! with joy my heart is singing
Joy, joy, wonderful joy
Joy of my desire
Love has filled our human story
Joy to the world! sound forth
Joy to the world, the angels come
I have found His grace is all complete
I trust in God through darkest night
Joy wings to God our song
Joyful, joyful, joyful, joyful, Christmas day is here
Joyful in Thy House of Prayer
Joyful is the dark, holy, hidden, God
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
Come to the Savior, make no delay
The sun shines bright, the sky is light
Joyful light, so pure and glowing
Be glad, my heart! now fear no more
Joyful tidings of a Savior
Hymns of sweetest praise let all his children sing
O what blessing Jesus brings
Sing with a tuneful heart
Joyfully singing to the Lord
Joyfully we greet the coming of this blessed Wesak Day
I'm on my way to heaven above Where all are free from care
Slaves and children, take a stand
Joyous light of glory
Jesus Christ our Savior
Joyous light of heav'nly glory
See the harvest field before you gleaming
Come, come, Little ones, come
In God the Lord be glad and light
Open hearts and open doors
Jubilee, Jubilee
I am through the lone night waiting
Judge eternal, throned in splendour
Judge me, God of my salvation
Judge me, O GOD, and plead my cause
Judge me, O Lord, for I the paths
Judge me, O Lord, for walk I do
Judge me, O Lord, who only can
Judge me, O Lord, with upright heart
[Judging Among Divine Pretenders]
He comes! he comes! the trumpet sound
Pressed my soul with future prospect
Lo he comes in clouds descending
God cometh, let the heart prepare
Sinner spurning mercyâ€™s hand
Junior stewards loyal
Peal the gospel tidings forth, with happy shout and song
I am weak, but thou art strong
Just a closer walk with thee
Just a few more days and my soul shall soar
Do you ever stop, my friend, to think
Living in a world of trouble, torn by bitter war and strife
Just a little sunshine on the rain
I once was lost in sin But Jesus took me in
How the joyful praises roll
Soon this life will all be over
Daily we grow fonder of the friends up yonder
When clouds above hide the sun from view
Harps are ringing in a cloudless land
Golden bells are ringing
Just as a lamb is led to the slaughter
Just as a lost and thirsty deer
I want to live just as He wants me to live
Just as I am, without one plea
Just as I am, thine own to be,
Just as I am, without one plea
Just because it's etched in gold
Jesus gave His life to pardon ev'ry nation
It's just because He loves me He's been so good to me
Just beyond the darksome valley
Just beyond the river Jordan
There are many little children who are sad
Just beyond the golden sunset
If you want happiness and blessings as you go on this earthly way
When troubled and burdened with life's heavy load
Just casting all your care on Jesus
Look to the Savior, my friend, to you a blessing He'll send
If talent you have to sing the Lord's praise
Just for me, just for me
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, just for Thyself alone
Just for today I'll walk along life's journey
Rejoice with me, rejoice with me
Just imagine having a world
Just Judge of heav'n, against my foes
Just Judge of Heav'n, against my Foes
Just believe that He has heard you pray
Though troubles and trials overtake you
Some doubters are trying God's Word to revise
He'll take away all of your heartaches
My God has given rich supply
Brother, while this world you're traveling through, speak a little word for the Master true
Just on the threshold, O why not come in
Just one hour alone with Jesus
Just one step, just one step, you who doubtfully stand
The future veiled before us lies
Just one thing have I desired
Let me not be just a hearer of your Word
Just over the river there lies a fair land
I've a home of wonderful beauty over the river
There is a home that's free from sorrow
Just beyond the rolling river there's a home for me
I soon shall reach that home in glory that is decked with jewels rare
I'm only a stranger in this dreary land
I want to stop what I'm doing and just say "thanks"
Brother, when your load is hard to bear
When your pathway is rugged and your load is hard to bear
Do you long His child to be
When you are discouraged and lonely
When the sable robe of death is placed around us
What is making life so sweet and bright to me?
We hear so much about shortage
If you would be happy each day
Not just to kneel with the angels
Just to know that Jesus loves me
Just to know and do Thy will, Lord
Just to know Him is to love Him
Just to know Him!
As I wandered thru the valley
I am the way, the truth the life
Jesus said I'll go and prepare for you a place
Jesus the Savior, ruler of all
When you are weary and burdened with fear
WHAT can I say to cheer a world of sorrow
[Justice is a Child of Mercy]
Justice like a river, flowing to the sea
God, give the king your good judgment
Vain are the hopes the sons of men

I am justified by the Savior's blood
[Justified Freely]
Kanzeon, Compassionate One
Away with sadness, O friend, let days of trouble all end
O comrades travel onward ever singing
Keep awake, be always ready
Great Ruler of the land and sea
You may have God's richest blessing
We've enlisted in the fight
Oh, brother as you go along
Keep in mind that Jesus Christ
If we die with the Lord
VALIANT soldier, marching to the fray
Would you help some comrade
If you want to know the joy of singing
Jesus gives the message of redeeming love
Glad song of love is flying now
Keep looking to Jesus
When sorrows come into your life and burdens would press you down
Lord, I want to live for thee
Oh, Savior, seal my heart
Keep me in the shadow of the cross
Keep me, Lord Jesus keep me
Keep me in touch with thee
Keep me, O God of grace
Keep me true, Lord Jesus, keep me true
Thou hast saved me, Lord, from sin
Many years I wandered from the God above
Sometimes, the shadows gather
When you feel weakest, dangers surround
Keep on believing, Jesus is near
Do you often grow discouraged
Tell the story far and wide, how the Christ was crucified
[Keep on Keepin' On]
Weary brother astray, trust the Saviour today
Keep on marching with a fighting faith
As we daily go about
When your heart is burdened with a load of care
Keep on praying till you pray it thro'
Keep on praying till the answer comes
Keep on praying, God is ever near
Lift your heart and your voice in sweet anthems of praise
As you travel the changing path of life's rugged way
As you travel thru this weary earthland below
If you're in the battle for the Lord and right
Fight the fight for God and right, with courage ev'ry day
Brother, as you travel along
On the hilltops, on the mountains
Jesus Lord and Master reigning now above
The Lord has prepared for us a home up yonder 'neath heaven's starry dome
Where, O brother, are you going
Keep pressing on, forget the things
Keep shining, keep shining, and never grow dim
Sing a cheerful song as onward you journey
As to the home in glory-land you go
If you glad smiles are giving it will make life worth living
Keep step with Jesus: He Who leads
Keep step with the Master
If there is abundance of joy in your heart
Oh, brother, if the Lord has saved you from sin, and thru His own blood you're holy within
Keep telling the Story of Love
In the Christian warfare with the hosts of sin
Martinâ€™s dream for all of us so set his soul afire
When your sins are all forgiven, and you're walking in the light
Keep the foe retreating
Sitting by the fire at evening
Keep the home fires burning, never growing low
As we daily press onward to the home of delight
The world is full of sin and sadness
If I am a steward true
Lift your voices to the Lord
As you travel over the land, making known the tidings grand
If your soul is saved from sin
While trav'ling on life's weary road
Keep the touch of God on your soul
Keep thou the door of my lips, O Lord
Keep thou thy mind as a garden
Keep thy faith and youthful vigor
O brother, if you have started to that City of rest
Tho' tempted and tried and sorrow betide
In the troubles and trials on the way of life
Father divine, hear in this hour
Oh, blessed Lord, help us to sing
As thou wilt, O Savior, lead us
Brother, if the way is growing long, and the world to you is going wrong
Keep what you have believed
Keep your covenant with Jesus
There's a land of joy and gladness
Keep your eyes uplifted, workers for the Master
Do you long to journey onward, where the skies are always blue
Keep your glad heart singing as on you go
Let us all unite to sing
O keep your heart swept and garnished
Keep your lamp trimmed and burning bright
Keep your lamps trimmed and burning
Are you redeemed and by grace made whole?
How wondrous is God's saving grace
I am singing on the journey to the land of endless day
I've a song of delight in my heart all the while
Happy hearts and faces bright
Moment by moment, day by day
We are kept each day all along the way
Kept by the power of God
My God! the covenant of Thy love 
Oh, to be Kept for Jesus
Satisfied my soul's deep longing
Kind and merciful God, we have sinned
Kind are the words that Jesus speaks
Children of God here below
Kind Maker of the world, O hear
Kind souls, who for the miseries moan
Kindle a flame to lighten the dark
Oh! Lord you know I'm praying for that Kindly Light
How long shall strong drink

Now we come in thy name loving Christ

Knocking, knocking with pierced hands
He is knocking, softly knocking at the door
Knocking, knocking, who is there?

Shepherds all were sleeping with their flocks that night
Know, ye that are of Adam's race
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Know ye what I have done to you?
Knowing my failings, knowing my fears
Knowing not the great Creator
All I once held dear, built my life upon
When my eyes behold the stars

O soul astray, look up today
There is life for a look at the Crucified One
There's a loving invitation in the Book of Life divine
Life for the poor was hard and tough
Life-giving bread, as our hearts are transformed anew
For bread that is broken we give thanks

Life illumes the radiant dew drop
My sins were washed away at Calvary

[Light and Salt You Called Your Friends]
[Light and Salvation is the Lord for Me]
Thou glorious Lord! mine eyes at last unsealed
Will there be light
When comes the close of my day and skies are silvered with gray
Light dawns on a weary world
Light, ere the dawn in beauty broke
God is gracious and kind
On a lone hillside three were crucified
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze
Darkness of earth will vanish away
There's a light in the valley
Light is dawning 'mong the hills
Light is shining round me
Light is the burden I bear for the King
Light more glorious than the sun
No more tears, no more pain
All the earth is ablaze with the glory of God

Light that passes through a prism
[Light the Fire Again]
Light upon our gloom arising
[Light Upon Us, Dove Descending]
[Light's abode, celestial Salem]
Light's glittering morn bedecks the sky
Walking with Jesus the Savior
Like a bird on the deep far away from its nest
Like a breeze from the ocean Thy love comes to me
Like a candle flame
like a child love would send to reveal and to mend
[Like a Deer for Cool Streams Panting]
My soul is thirsting for God
Athirst is my soul for God, the living God
Like a flowing stream
Like a healing stream in a barren desert
Where He leads me I must follow
Like a mighty army

Like a mother who has borne us
Like a river O God, you flow through our lives
Like a river glorious
Ev'ry joy or trial

For love is stronger than death
Say to the cities of Judah
Like a thief in the night
Like a tiny seed of mustard
Like a tree beside the waters
[Like Abraham of Old, the Chosen Couple Brings]
Like as a father Cares or his child
Like as the panting hart doth bray
I call out to you
Good it is that we should sing
If the Spirit of the Lord moves in my soul [Si el EspÃ­ritu de Dios]
Like fishermen who left their boats
Like the little flowers that we cherish to
Like gentle dew the blessings
With a loud voice I cry to the Lord
I love to think of Jesus, when he was here on earth
Like Mary, when the angel came
Like music at the stilly hour
Like Noah's weary dove
Blessed those who fear the Lord
Like showers on meadows newly mown
Like silver lamps in a distant shrine
Like the action of the ground, on its axis turns around
Like the beams that from the sun
Like the colors of the rainbow
Like the golden sun ascending
Like the golden sun ascending, In the darkly clouded sky
Just to be more like the Master
Like the murmur of the dove's song
If you would make the world brighter
Like thousand mountains brightly crowned
I know a gal that you don't know
[Lilies of the Field]
The call "to arms" is sounding
Linked in the bond of peace
Lion of Judahâ€™s tribe, draw near
List, afar, what angel voices
List to the clanging bells of time
Listen, all people who live in this world

Live Christ thru-out the day
Do you hear the invitation, "Come to me?"
Live for Jesus, live for Jesus, Serve Him every day
When I'm alone or when I lose my way
Live into hope of captives freed
If your soul would triumph in this earthly fray
Live to be a blessing in this world of ours
Live without sin! It cannot be!
Some go to church on Sunday
Lives brought together this holy day

Living Fountain, freely flowing
Living God, your word has called us
As I tread life's road 'neath a heavy load
How great the chasm
I've left the house of bondage, 'way down in Egypt's land
Down here I tread A rough and winding road
I've left the broad pathway of sorrow
Daily I am living for my blessed Saviour
Come where God gives us hope
Once I was a sinner, wandering far away
I'm living with Jesus, as moments go by
[Living Lord, Our Praise We Render]
Onward I'm going truly knowing Jesus is leading me
We greet the smiling Eastertide

Lo; all ye servants of the Lord
Lo at noon 'tis sudden night
Lo fair thou art, lo fair my Love!
Lo! from the desert homes
Lo, God to heav'n ascendeth
Lo! golden light rekindles day
Lo! He comes, an infant stranger
Lo! he comes, with clouds descending
Lo, He is dead! The suffering Christ is dead
Lo, He sent His Word and healed them
Lo, heaven and earth, and sea and air
Lo! hills and mountains shall bring forth
Lo, how a rose e'er blooming
O glorious fair blooming
Lo, how a rose is growing
Lo! how restless foes my life pursue!
Lo, in its brightness the morning arising
Lo, in the east appears a star
Lo! in the last of days behold 
Lo, summer comes again! And after springtide rain
Lo the almighty King of glory
Lo, the clouds of night are rending
Lo, the crimson banners loyal
Lo, the earth is risen again

Lo, the Lord extends his hand
Lo the pilgrim Magi
Lo, the signals flying
Lo! the sin-avenging Lord

Loaves were broken, words were spoken
Praise God the Saviour
Lof vare dig o Jesu Krist
The Skylark sings a lovely song
[Lone, Afraid, the Wanderer Rested]
[Lone He Prays Within the Garden]
Lonely days are left behind me, and I sing for joy
Hark, I hear the voice of Jesus To the harvest fields away
O Lord Jesus, high in Heaven
Long ago and far away
Long ago, God reached in love
Long long ago in Bethlehem
Long ago on Easter day
Long ago, prophets knew
Long ago the little children
Long ago, when Pharaoh's daughter walked along the riverside
Long-awaited Holy One
Long before creation's dawning
[Long Before the Reign of Kings]
Long before the world is waking
Long did both kings and prophets wait
Long hast thou stood, O church of God
Long in the spirit-world my soul had sought
Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
Long, long enough have Christian men
Long plunged in sorrow, I resign
Long Road, Long Road, where you take me?
Long sunk in superstition's night
Long years ago in Bethlehem
Over the river voices I hear
Direct unto my God
Companions of thy little flock
I long to behold him arrayed
O, that I had a bosom friend
This old world today is dark with shadows
O could I sing from day to day
Sure 'tis in vain to seek for bliss
Jesus, I thirst, and go I must
Oh, land of rest and glory, built for me on high
Sad pris'ners in a house of clay
Like the young and thirsty deer
Look and learn from the birds of the air
I've a message from the Lord, Hallelujah!
Look to the Savior on Calvary's tree
Look at me, O God!
Look at this man, born of God
Sinner, come, oh, come to Jesus
Look away to Christ, look to Him and live
Is thy heart defiled within
When the way seems dark and the road is rough and long
Look away to the Cross where Jesus died
Give us a sign that we might believe in you
When life's race has been run and my labors are done
Look ever to Jesus
Look ever to Jesus!
Soon the Savior will come from His heavenly throne
You may look for me, for I'll be there
I often think of loved ones leaving
When you are burdened, discouraged or sad
Look from the sphere of endless day
Though your sins be quite as scarlet
Beneath the paper wrappings, there's an open stable door
Look not behind thee; O sinner beware
Look not on the wine cup
Look now he stands stones could not hold him down for long
Look, O Christian! see thy Savior
Look on the fields they are white unto harvest
Look: such horror, torn, then tortured
Look to Jesus weary one, Look and live, look and live
Look there! the Christ, our Brother
Has your life grown dreary
Look to Him now, look to Him now
Look to Jesus, when in danger
Do you need a friend to help you?
Look to Jesus, dying sinner
Look to Jesus, my brother, when in sorrow or woe
When the cares of life are pressing
You are lost in sin, no hope within
When the storms of life sweep o'er your soul
Look to the God of heav'n above for guidelines ev'ry day
If you from sin are longing to be free
Look to the Savior
Art thou laden with a weight oppressing
Our Redeemer and Saviour came from heaven one day
Look to the skies, there's a celebration
Salvation
Look toward the mountains of the Lord
O weary one, when sore opprest
Look up! Look up! Look up!
Tho rough and steep may seem the way
Look up and not down, O Christians!
Brother, look up and smile, over each weary mile
Although you stumble in the way
Look up, look up O troubled soul
Brother, why sit and ponder over some trouble yonder?
O soul on life's highway without a song
Look up to thy God again
Look up ye saints direct your eyes
Look upon us blessed Lord
Look what God is doin'
Jesus has done the works that man can never do
Look who gathers at Christ's table!
Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious
I am looking, for God's tomorrow
My thoughts are back home, with mother and dad
Looking back, O God, we wonder of that time in history
I look beyond the distant hills
I had rather be found in the highway of God
With an eye of faith I see a place
Here among the shadows (living) in a lonely land
I'm looking for the coming of my Savior from on high
Looking to Jesus, letting Him lead
I have fixed mine eyes upon the goal
Let us run our race with patience
Looking unto Jesus when my heart is weak
Looking unto Jesus, Looking unto Jesus

LORD, you have searched my life and know
[Lord, You Have Seen Your Church's Needs]
[Lord, You Have Weaned My Heart from Pride]
[Lord, You Need No House]
Lord, you search me and you know me
[Lord, You Sometimes Speak in Wonders]
Lord, your hands have formed this world
Lord, your praise we sing
Lord, your voice in Eden's garden
Great is the faithfulness You've shown to me
Things we've done and things we've said
Now, Lord, another of thy days
When, O dear Jesus, when shall I
Lord, hast thou suffered me to see
Today God bids the faithful rest
Great God of boundless might
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
For the kingdom the power, the glory are yours
You are losing your soul
In Edenâ€”Memory e'er will tell
Lost to the sound of the Spirit's sweet call
Lost, but Jesus found me
Will you from your God and heaven
Where is thy prospect, sinner?
You are standing all day idle, seeking not the living way
Lost in sight of the harbor
Far out on the tide of life's tempest-tossed sea
Lost in the night do the people yet languish
Lost in the wildering maze of sin
O Lord I feel like crying today
Lot, Lot, foolish man
Loud HALLELUJAH sing
Loud HALLELUJAH sing
Loud hallelujahs sing, From heavens Jehovah praise
Loud our neighbors' call is heard
Loud to the Prince of Heaven
Onward moves the great Eternal In the order of His plan
Brood o'er us with thy sheltering wing
Let brethren cease of party names to speak
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels
I will sing the praise of the One who died
When I went to Christ one day, on my knees in prayer
Faith, the rock on which we firmly rest
How great was that love
Sweet is my song as onward I go
My life is full of sunshine, and peace is in my soul
God's great love is shining like a happy golden sunbeam
Came He to Bethlehem's manger
From the shadows of the night
Love came down and died for sin
Love came down at Christmas
As we daily journey in this wilderness below
I once was worn and sad, but now I'm free and glad
Love consecrates the humblest act,
I sing of the love that is matchless and free
On the mountains far away
Love divine, O sweet the precious sound
Love divineâ€”a theme for praising
Love divine, all loves excelling
Love divine has lifted me
Love divine, quell now our fear
All the room was hushed and still
Love eternal and supreme
United in affection dear
Wonderful love that rescued me
When I was lost in sin and disgrace
Love from God, our Lord
Love God with all your soul and strength
Love is patient, love is kind
Love has come - a light in the darkness! 
With one voice the angels sing
When we think of how our Savior
Love I ask for, love I claim
Love! if thy destined sacrifice am I
Love in Christ is strong and living
Love inspired the anger
Love is enduring, bearing all things
Love is flowing: love is flowing
[Love Is Long Suff'ring; Love Is Kind]
Love is my theme, O blissful delight
Love is patient, love is kind, Never boastful, never proud
I was lost in sin, the Savior took me in
Talk about love, how it makes life complete
For God so loved this sinful world
Love is the law that Jesus taught
Love is the Lord whom I obey
Love is the only law
Love is the sunlight
Love is the theme of which I now sing
Love is the theme of saints above
Love is the touch of intangible joy
Love is the welcome that comes from the heart
[Love It Is Unites Us]
O, love of God so boundless and free
Love knocks and waits for us to hear
When the road I travel here is so lonely
We shall never have a thought of straying
I'm walking in the Light Divine
Love, light a candle in my heart
I've left the dark pathway of evil and strife
Love, love, love! That's what it's all about!
Before a cross uplifted high
Love must be sincere and honest
[Love Never Fails]
I can speak the tongues of ev'ry nation
Love of Jesus, all divine
Now let my faith grow strong, and rise
[Love One Another]
God loved the world so much he sent us his only son
A new commandment give I unto you
That we from our hearts
For the Lord is your rock
Turn the other cheek
My friends, do you know what I have done for you?
Love one another as I have loved you
Love opened wide the door for me
Brighter grows the pathway as we travel along
Does your sunshine make a bow
If I speak in tongues of men or angels
Love songs from heaven are filling the earth
Love has a language, all its own making
Though in declaring Christ to the sinner
Sky and day and night declare the glory of the Lord
Love the Lord, love the Lord
Love the Lord, your God with all your heart
Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart
Love, the thread of quilted kindness
Of all the joys we mortals know
O love unending
Love us into fullness
Love was shown upon the cross
Love was when God became a man
Living God, creator of all life
Love, who made me in your likeness
Love will be our Lenten calling
Love for ages past, supreme over wrong
Love won on Calvay
Love, wonderful love, The love of Christ to me
When I came to Jesus with my heavy load of sin
Yonder within the portals
Loved with everlasting love
Lovely child, holy child
Lovely in your littleness
Lovely Infant, tender Jesus
I am Maker of mountains
Since I have turned my heart from win and Christ the Lord abides within
I hear a voice a low sweet voice
Once in the dear dead days beyond recall
Love's redeeming work is done; Fought the fight, the battle won
Happy in the Savior's love, ready for the home above
My heart o'erflows with holy joy
Pull back the veil on the dawn of creation
Lovest thou Me? I hear my Saviour say
All my being, bless the Lord
Living for Jesus
Would the little children find
Loving me, forsaking His heav'nly home
Loving Savior, be Thou near me
Loving Shepherd, kind and true
Loving Spirit, Loving Spirit
Like the sound of soothing music
Kept in the hollow
All hail the glad tidings, the Saviour is mine!
Low, in the grave Christ lay
Lowly bending at Thy footstool
Lowly shepherds of Judea
Loyal and true to the Savior is our motto
We'll be loyal in service to our Lord and King
From over hill and plain
Magnify the Lord
My soul magnifies the Lord (Proclama mi alma la gradeza del SeÃ±or)
My soul and spirit, filled with joy
God raises up a child to save
Blest be the Lord, the God of Israel
Through his holy prophets
Todo mi ser celebra lo grande que es Dios (Sing out my soul, the greatness of the Lord)
He has looked down with favor
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
Sing out, my soul, for God has raised and blessed me
I sing with all my soul and praise the Lord
You are the God of my heart
The wretched prodigal behold
Just and devout old Simeon lived
While humble shepherds watched their flocks
Now, Lord, you have kept your word
Now let your servants, Lord, depart in peace
Now, O Lord, Dismiss Your Servants
Now, O God, let your servant go
From highest Heaven I come to tell
We remember
The vision of a dying world
I will bless the Lord forever
The Christ of God hath come
The mouth of the Lord hath spoken
[Magnificat]
My soul gives glory to the Lord
For he has favored his lowly one
[Magnificat: My Soul Flies Free]
Magnificent free grace, arise
Magnify the Lord
Magnify the Lord with me
Majestic mountains
No mortal can with Him compare
Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Majesty, worship His majesty
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth!
Make a joyful noise to God!
Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands
When it's raining and the sun is shining
Make channels for the streams of love
O youth, with life before you, and with gladness all around
Make haste, O God, to save me
Make haste, O man, to live
Make haste, O my God, to deliver, I pray
On the sea of time, like a vessel, we sail
The blood-red sweat in the garden
Your soul, like a vessel so sturdy and fair
Make just one brand new friend
Out in the highways and byways of life
Make me a captive, Lord
Make me a channel of blessing today
Make me a channel of your peace
[Make Me a Servant]
Make me a stranger on earth, dear Savior
Make me a worker for Jesus, Faithful and ready and true
MAKE me aware of thee, O Lord
Saviour, come and dwell in me
[Make Mention That His Name Is Exalted]
[Make Music to the Lord Most High]
Make my heart thy throne, O Lord
Make my life what it ought to be
A Saviour of infinite love I have found
Weary wanderer, stop and listen
Taste of this goodness! and feast at this banquet
Make our earthly souls a field
Help us act in justice
Make room, make room for Jesus
Make room within my heart, O God
Working for Jesus as you travel the road to glory
Make songs of joy to Christ, our head
Make straight the way: the city streets
Is the world brighter for your being in it
Make thee ready, as best thou art able
Make thyself known, Lord
Make us a house of prayer
Lord Jesus Christ, Word of God and light of all the world
You are holy: make us holy!
[Make Us, O God, Ashamed of Sin]
Make us one, Lord, make us one
If our life in Christ means anything at all
Make us true servants to all those in need
Open up your tender arms
Make us your prophets, Lord
Make way, make way, for Christ the King
The King is coming, naught can stay
A patre unigenitus, Through a maiden is come
Make ye a joyful noise unto
[Make Your Home in Me]
I am the true vine, you the branches
Every fox, a den; every bird, a nest
If I make one prayer to you my God
[Make Your Prayer and Music One]
If you want to hear the Lord's Well done, when the race in this world you have won
Maker of all, eternal king
Maker of all things, God most high
Maker of all, whose hand we trace
Maker of earth, to thee alone
Maker of the earth and heaven
Maker, Upholder, Ruler
Lord, what is man? Extremes how wide
Man more than man
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
Man of sorrows--what a name
Man of Sorrows, wrapt in grief
The poet sings a mournful song
As water cold to fainting souls
Mankind's ice age had enclosed to us
Man cannot live by bread alone
There are many bright mansions up in heaven I know
My Savior has gone to prepare me a place
Mansions bright have been prepared just beyond the blue
I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
Many a gift did Christ impart
We are fallen but we are forgiven
Many are the lightbeams
Now one has the gift of wisdom
God of change and glory
I have many little friends
Many mansions are over yonder
Many sons to glory bringing
Many thoughts stir my heart as I ponder alone
No more auction block for me
Many sorrows hard and bitter
[Maranatha!]
In your image you have fashioned us
Maranatha, Maranatha!

Mary, when you heard the warning
Long time ago in Bethlehem
[Mary's Salidummay]
My soul doth glory in your love, O Lord
Attend my people to my law, Incline your listening ear
Unto Jehovah with my voice
The mercies of JEHOVAH sing
Master and Lord, 'tis good to be here
Here am I, O Master to be used
Master, no offering
Master of eager youth
When a storm was raging on dark Galilee
Master, speak! thy servant heareth
[Master, the Tempest Is Raging]
Master, we call to mind Thy Word
Master, what shall I do
Thus spoke the Saviour of the world
'Twas on that night, when doomed to know
Father of all! we bow to thee

May almighty God bless you
May choirs of angels lead you
For the longest day

May God bestow on us His grace
May God bless and keep you

Happy are they who reflect his faith
In the warfare that is raging
May God Embrace Us with His Grace
Temptations are always abounding
May God support you all your days
May God's blessing surround you each day
May God's sheltering wings
The Master has gone to a distant country
We have walked side by side on our journey below
May I enter Sion's portal
May light come into your eyes
May our worship be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord
May saints and angels lead you on
May the angels lead you
There is one thing I ask of God
May the martyrs come to welcome you

May the Lord grant His peace unto thee
May the Lord, mighty God
May the love of Christ enfold us
May the mind of Christ, my Savior
May the mind of Christ, our Savior
May the peace of God be your peace
May the rainbow always touch your shoulder
For ev'rything there is a season
May the road rise up to meet you
Sing out, sing out, while we're together
May the sending One defend you
May the word of God strengthen you
The law of the Lord is perfect
May the words of our mouths
May the work I've done speak for me
May these my words be written in a book
May this day be a day
Sin has sundered us from God
May this mind be in us
May Thy Church our shelter be
May thy people wake from slumber
This is the bread of Israel's wand'ring
May we but wait upon Love's word
May we make moments of peace and of light
May we praise you, O Lord
May our eyes be opened to see
May we Thy precepts, Lord, fulfill
May you journey in faith
May you run and not be weary
Peace in hearth and home
May your hands be the hands of Christ
May your love be upon us, O Lord
[May Your Name Be Hallowed]
My Lord will come; it may be soon
Me alone, me alone
I can see that dear old couple
Me, Lord, not in thy dreadful wrath, correct
Sing, rivers and rainstorms!
Today Immanuel feeds his sheep
Arise, my Soul, with Wonder see
Lord, teach us to love Thee day by day
Oft I am so lonely in this world of care
Within thy temple's sacred courts
Meek, patient Lamb of God, impart
Meek, patient Lamb of God, to thee
Meet again when life [time] is over
Just beyond these earthly scenes, Past the vail that intervenes
On the bright and golden shore
Meet my need, Lord
Come on my fellow-pilgrims, come
In the city the struggle continues
Mein Br'utgam, fuehre mich spazieren
There are grand old melodies ringing in my soul
Over topping mountains and filling valleys

Remember Davids troubles Lord
Remember, Virgin Mary
[Memorial Acclamation]
When we eat this bread
Lord, by your cross and resurrection
Save us, Savior of the world
I'd like to be a child again
Memories now to mind I recall
When we reach our Father's dwelling
Each cooing dove and sighing bough
Now the days are long and lonely
By Babel's streams we sat and wept
To the pleasant Hall of Memory
Loved ones once among our number
There's a mighty conflict on
Men go to God when they are sore bestead
Men who walk in folly's way
Men write their verses, night of silence broken
Ev'ry morning that breaks there are mercies anew
[Merciful and Gracious Be]
Merciful God, to Thee we cry
Merciful God, vouchsafe to me
Mercy alone can meet my case
Mercy and goodness, O my God
Mercy, and judgment, claim my song
[Mercy, Blessing, Favour, Grace]
[O sinner, will you listen?]
Mercy is welcome news indeed
Gather the people, the children, the elders
Mercy, O thou Son of David
Jesus, oh, so poor and lowly
Mercy, peace, and love be yours
Mercy speaks by Jesuâ€™s blood
You who long in sin have wandered
Merrily to Bethlehem the shepherds came
Christ is born, and He is king
Smiling lips and laughing eyes
Come to the ark of refuge
[Message of the Cross]
Messiah, full of grace
From His throne above
Methinks I hear my Savior call
Methinks I stand upon the rock
Thus speaks the heathen: How shall man
[Micah 6:8]
You may not have the strength to make all right again
O GOD, Thou hast deserted us
O thou my God, deliver me
O GOD, have mercy upon me
O ye assembly, do ye now
O GOD, to me be merciful
O Mighty God, preserve thou me
Mid all the traffic of the ways
Mid Scenes of confusion and creature complaints
Rise up, and bless your God
Midnight stars make bright the sky
Midday was turned to midnight
'Midst all the priests of Jewish race
Midst the lillies blooming yonder
Mig lyster nu at trÃ¦de
Mighty God, we give You praise
Mighty God, come build Your mighty Church upon Your mighty Word
You are the Lord of heaven
[Mighty God, Power Over Heaven and Earth]
Mighty God, the First, the Last
Mighty God, we humbly pray
Mighty God, while angels bless you
Mighty in victory, glorious in majesty
What can take a dying man
Mighty LORD, the God of vengeance
Mighty man, why boast of evil?
Mighty mortal, boasting evil
There was a shake and a rattle
O Thou our King, enthroned in realms on high
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus to me, His love and His mercy are boundless and free
Satan has no authority here in this place
Joy will be ringing on that morning bright and fair
That glorious day is drawing nigh
Come on board the ship for glory (Key)
Millions within Thy courts have met
Min sjÃ¤l skall lofva Herran
Mindful of a constant Friend
Mindful of our human frailty
Mine, what rays of glory bright
Mine, all mine, this blessed Lord and Saviour
Once my road was hard and dreary
Mine eyes are now closing to rest
Mine eyes have seen the dawning
Mine eyes unto the mountains
Mine, mine, mine
Mine the cross, and thine the glory
Shall I, for fear of feeble man, The Spirit's course in me restrain?
Before Thy throne, eternal King
Miracle of grace
The earth shall know the glory of the presence of the Lord
God speed the day when thousands shall arise
From Greenland's icy mountains, from India's coral strand
Our Father in heaven, On thee do we call
Come, let us sing before the Lord
On the shore beyond the sea
Mistful are our waiting eyes
Mitt Hjarta, tru med Tryggje
Farewell, this festal day must close
How vainly do the heathen strive
Master Potter, why do You labor all day
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine
Moments and minutes, hours and days
Sweet moments of pray'r I love
[Moon and Bright Sun]
More about Jesus would I know
[More Abundantly]
To our Savior we are clinging
There is wondrous grace coming from above
More faith in thee, O Christ
More fully Thine, dear Savior
More holiness give me
More light shall break from out thy Word
More like Christ, my heart is praying
We would be more like Jesus
More and more like Jesus I would ever be
Blessed Jesus, let me be from day to day
More like you, Jesus, more like you
Lord, you are my mercy
O Lord, Your love is so vast and so wide
More love, more power
More love to Thee, O Christ, my King
More love to Thee, O Christ
More marred than any man's
I have been washed in the fountain
Lord, You are more precious than silver
I've a wonderful message so blessed and true
The love of my Savior is precious to me
More than a conqueror
There's many a blessing glad and sweet
[More Than Conquerors]
All hail the mighty Conqueror
Jesus, Lord, in Whom the Father
Things of the earth that we cherish
[More Than Watchers for the Morning]
Have you on the Lord believed?
Morn awakes and woodlands ring
Morn awakes, behold the glory
Morn of beauty, joyous morn
Morning awakes, and morn awaking sings
The golden morning
Morning comes with light all-cheering
Morning breaking, songbird in the sky
Morning glory, starlit sky
Morning has broken
Ye clouds and darkness, hosts of night
This day God gives me
Sing your joy, proclaim God's glory!
Jesus, Savior, friend indeed
Dawn's radiance washes over the earth
The morning light dispels the night
Morning of splendor, burst forth in my heart
Morning of the Sabbath day
When the morning bells are ringing, We to Thee our song would raise
Loving God, I offer you today
Show us your mercy Lord
Morning spreads her crimson rays
Morning star from night's dark shade
Morning star, O cheering sight
On the first day of the week
Mornings will I seek Thee
Morn's roseate hues have decked the sky
Before my journey is complete
Mortals, behold your dying God
Mortals, give ear, the awful day
Moses, go, sleeping on the Nile
Moses, he gave the fiery law
Let heaven's wide arch, while I shall speak
Most ancient of all mysteries
I love to shout, I love to sing
Brothers on the road, most done traveling
Most glorious day of the world's expectation
Most High and Holy Trinity!
Most High, omnipotent, good Lord
Most Holy God, the Lord of heaven
Most holy Lord and God, Holy, Almighty God
Most holy Lord, I love thy truth
Most perfect is the law of God
The world may to my spirit call
Most precious in our Savior's sight
Most splendid and resplendent Light
Most wonderful of all things is
Most wondrous is of all on earth The kingdom Jesus founded
Most wondrous maker of the light
They told me in Heav'n there's a wonderful home
In a lone graveyard, near the dear old home
When I'm thru with all my trouble
In my memory there linger thoughts of mother
Mother, Child, and Birthing Spirit, hear us now, we pray
Come and whisper soft and low
Mother Earth, our Mother birthing
Mother, I am tired, let me slumber
Past earth's dreary shadows
I wonder if mother is praying for me
Some mothers' boy has gone astray from home
When aweary with life and its burdens of care
Motherhood: a gift, a calling
Mothering God, you gave me birth
I am thinking today of a face far away that on earth once was youthful and fair
Motherâ€™s gone to yonder city
Mother's gone and we are lonely
Mother's left this world of sorrow
Mother's gone a-marketing
How dark and dreary was the day
Mother's gone to that blest home
O the sweetest place in memory
As a child I often rested with my head on mother's knee
Mother's love brightly shines and it never declines
Like the flow'rs that bloom in spring
[Mother's Newborn Treasure]
There's a blessed, sweet old story
O soul of mine, mount high, mount high
Mountains are all aglow with autumn colors so bright
Mountains, bow your heads majestic
Mourn not the dead
Mourning, and drooping, here I lie
They're mourning tonight at the old hearthstone
Move forward! valiant men and strong
Move forward, soldiers of the cross
Move me, move me; move me to do your will
I want the Lord to move me
Moved by the Gospel, let us move
Since I've left the valley with its lonely shades of night
I'm going away some wonderful day to my new home
Much brighter than a thousand suns
[Much in Our Minds]
Much more hath God in store
A glorious angel from Heaven came
May this water keep us aware
There is music in my soul, While from my lips hallelujahs roll
I'm glad that I can say I'm in the glory way
The bells chime "Happy Christmas!"
Music I love--but ne'er a strain
On that cold and bitter plain
"Must I go and empty handed"
Must Jesus bear the cross alone
[Must the Sword Devour Forever]
Must we not then with patience wait
Mute are the pleading lips of him
My days of loneliness are gone
When sunshine had left me, my way had grown dim
Christ, my Anchor, sure and steadfast
When shadows overcast the sky, and stormy billows roll
Though the angry surges roll
There's a City of gold far above the blue sky
There is a mansion over yonder in that land of fadeless day
I have a home of wonderful beauty on the evergreen shore
There's a beautiful home in a realm all bright
I believe in God, the Father, That He made the heaven and earth
My Beloved, haste away
Ere last yearâ€™s moon had left the sky
In that happy home in glory I would dwell eternally
Thereâ€™s a home where Iâ€™m longing to go
Jesus, my blessed Jesus
I have a Friend so precious, so very dear to me
My soul is singing hallelujah as I go along the way
Sometimes my path is rough and thorny
My body is God's temple
My Bonnie is over the ocean
My breast is inspired 
My brethren all, remember well
A bud the Gardener gave me
It may be on the rugged plain
My business lies at wisdom's gate
I hear them calling to me
My cause is Godâ€™s, and I am still
My cause is God's, and I am His
My chearful mind a good design shall frame
As I think today of my childhood home
With visage marred till none could know
O what comfort is mine when the love-light I see
My Christian friends, in bonds of love
My Christian friends, to whom I speak
My Church, my Church, my dear old Church
No more my heart is lonely
My country, 'tis of thee
My course is run. Praise God, my course is run
Learn to live, live to love
There's a starry crown in the glory land
My daughters and my sons hear tell
My days are as the grass
I know that my days are numbered
My days, my weeks, my months, my years
[My Days of Waiting Ended]
My days on earth are almost gone
My dear Master, Jesus Christ
My dear Redeemer, dying God
My dear Redeemer see
My dearest Lamb, who bearest my grief
My dearest, lovely, native land
My dearest Redeemer, thou light of my days
Wonderful joy comes over me stealing
Some morn when I awake to hear
It's my desire to do some good thing
My desire to be like Jesus
I want to be like Jesus
So often I dream of my heavenly home
My earnest pray'r, O heav'nly father, hear
"My elder son, go work today
My soul is truly happy all the time
My heart resounds with joy that nothing can annoy
My eyes be open to your presence
My fairest crown, beyond all price
My faith bids me to tarry
My faith has found a resting place
As I move my way long
My lifeboat is sailing across the sea of time
My faith it is an oaken staff
My faith looks up to thee
MY faith looks up to thee
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary
My father and my mother dear
My Father, for another night
My Father! form thy child according to thine image
My Father God of powâ€™r and might
My Father, hear my prayer
He knows the bitter, weary way
My Father knows my need
Around me and within
What though the way be lonely
I trust in God wherever I may be
Here at thy table, Lord, we meet
My flesh shall slumber in the ground
My foes assault me with relentless hate
My food I'll get in serving Thee
I've a Friend, a precious Friend indeed
I have a Friend who help doth lend
I have found a precious Friend who walks beside me
I've found a Friend who is my all
All the days are filled with sunshine as I walk the narrow way
My friends, come listen awhile
My friends, I am going a long and tedious journey
This earthly life will soon be gone
[My Glory and the Lifter of my Head]
My goal is God himself, not joy, nor peace
My God, accept my heart this day
My God, and is Thy table spread
My God, at early dawn to thee I'll cry
My God, behold me lying
My God, beneath Thy watching eye
My God, how wonderful you are
My God, I am thine, What a comfort divine
My God, I ask and pray Thee
Through night and day Thy glory
My God! I know, I feel thee mine
My God, I know that I must die
My God, I leave to Thee my ways
My God, I love Thee for Thyself
My God, I love Thee: not because
My God, I thank Thee, Who hast made
My God, in Thee all fulness lies
If you dwell beneath the shelter
Jesus knows my ev'ry word and deed
My God is love, it never fails
The rivers are his, the mountains are his
My God is so great, so strong, and so mighty
Is your heart over-anxious, your days filled with fear
My God, lo, here before Thy face
My God, my Father, while I stray
My God, my God, and must I die
My God, My God, I cry to Thee
My God, my God, O why hast Thou
My God, my God, O why have you
All who see me scoff at me
My God, my God, why
Forsaken of God on Calvary
My GOD! my GOD! why leav'st thou me
My God, my Saviour, here this day
My God! O my God! Have you left me alone?
My God shall supply all your need
My God, to Thee I now commend
My God, where shall I wend my flight?
My God, who makes the sun to know
My God, my God, why have you abondoned me?
[My God, Why Have You Forsaken Me]
My God will add the rest
When I get up in Heaven
I sat in the deepening twilight
"My grace is sufficient for thee"
"My grace is sufficient"â€”The Saviour hath spoken
The seer came back from paradise
When night settles down on my pathway
With every temptation, besetment and snare
My gracious Redeemer I love
The Sabbath day--sweet day of rest--
My grateful soul shall bless the Lord
My great avenger thou, O Lord, to thee
There's a Friend who changeth never
My greatest friend is Jesus
My grieving soul revive, O Lord
As I travel on my way to the land of perfect day
Born of the Virgin Mary
When the storms of life are sweeping and I cannot see the way
My hand on myself, what is this here?
This is the carol that is ringing within my soul
I'm glad my faith on wings can rise
My harp upon the willows, grave
My heart, and all my ways, O God
My heart and voice I raise
In youthâ€™s sunny morning, while gay blossoms spring
My heart concludes, the bold in sin
My heart does overflow
My heart has been too long ensnared
My heart has heard an oracle
My heart is easy, and my burden light
My heart is fill'd with longing
My heart is fill'd with longing
My heart is filled with thankfulness
My heart is firmly fixed
I care no more for pleasures wrong
My heart is fixed, praise God!
Over in that bright and sunny clime above
My heart is fixed on Jesus, the sun of all my tho't;
My heart is full of admiration
My heart is full of Christ, and longs
My heart is greatly stirred
My heart is longing to praise my Savior
My heart is not exalted, LORD
My heart is overflowing
[My Heart Is Ready, O My God]
My heart is resting, O my God
My heart is singing, the bells are ringing
My heart is steadfast, God!
My heart is yearning ever
My heart its incense burning
[My Heart Leaps Up]
I bring my heart to Thee
My heart, O Holy Spirit
For He is Lord of all the earth, He's risen above
My heart, prepare to give account
My heart rejoiced to hear
[My Heart Rejoices]
[My Heart Rejoices in My God]
I have yielded myself to thy service,
My heart sings out with joyful praise
My heart sings when ever I think of Jesus
O wondrous grace! for guilty men
My heart speaks out on those who sin
My heart was glad to hear the welcome sound
My heart was sad because of sin
My heart will sing to you because of your great love
[My Heart's Bursting With God's Praises]
Lord I desire with Thee to live
My new life I owe to thee
I have a Friend in heaven
My heavenly home is bright and fair
Beyond the pale of earthly blight
I lift my eyes to the hills, from where does my help come?
[My Help Comes from the Lord]
I lift up my eyes toward the mountains
I will look to the hills from whence cometh my help
My help shall come from the Lord
Give me, my God, I pray
Is God for me? I fear not, though all against me rise
There is a home prepared for me, Beyond life's mortal year
I have a home far up in the sky
When life's faded flow'r shall freshen
I have a home up yonder in glory, on that bright and beautiful shore
There's a land of endless glory just beyond the swelling flood
I've a home of endless glory
I have a home in Glory
I've a happy home in heaven, far out beyond the starry sky
There is a land above the skies
My home is where my heart is
I have a happy home up yonder
I've got a home on the hills of glory
I know of a home
My home on earth will soon decay
I'm going along o'erflowing with song
I know there'll be no earthly duty
Above this world of sin and care, there is a City bright and fair
I am a pilgrim and a stranger in this weary, troubled land
My hope is built on nothing less
My hope is firmly set
My hope is in the Lord
My hope is in the Lord
My hope is still in Jesus
My hope, my all, my Savior thou
My hope my steadfast trust
I've tasted the joy of full salvation from heaven's King
My House shall be an House of Prayer
My inheritance is from the Lord
My injur'd cause, my great protector, plead
My inmost heart now raises
He has saved my soul, My Jesus
My Jesus, as thou wilt!
My Jesus, fair, was pierced by thorns
Now in a song of grateful praise
My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine
My Jesus, if the Seraphim
I'm a pilgrim on life's weary way
My blessed Companion, my King and my Guide
As I journey thro' life this I find
My life, as a year, had a bright springtime
My life flows on in endless song
My life I now to God resign
My life is hid in Jesus
My life is in You, Lord
Lord Jesus, I give Thee ev'rything
My life is Thine, Lord Jesus
My life is Yours, O Lord
With my whole heart I humbly seek You
My Saviour, Father, Guide and Friend
My light and my salvation, O Lord, whom shall I fear?
In my wrestling
You take all my guilt away
My lips will tell of your help
O what a lonesome feeling
I have a friend so precious, so very
My Lord, didst Thou endure such smart
My Lord, He is the fairest of the fair
My Lord, I did not choose you
My Lord, in glory reigning
I'm walking in the bright way, I'm fully trusting each day
I know my Lord is safely leading me
My Lord knows the way thru the wilderness
My Lord, my Life, my Love
My Lord, my Love, was crucified
My Lord, My Master, At Thy Feet Adoring
My Lord of light who made the worlds
My Lord was there when round my bed
You'll hear the trumpet sound
I have assurance sweet, a solace most complete
I will bless the Lord at all times!
I'm sailing on life's restless sea
If I labor here, for the Saviour dear
My Lord, you have examined me
My Lord, you wore no royal crown
All my sins are taken away
As I trudge along thru this world of care
My love colours outside the lines
My Maker, be Thou nigh
As on earth here I wander, with none to hold my hand
They tell me of a mansion bright
The despot's heel is on thy shore
My Master is the King of glory
My Master, see the time has come
My Master was a worker
I'm thinking of home, with mother and dad
There's a dear and precious Book
I never can forget the day
Sing me the song my mother sang
My mouth shall sing for aye Thy tender mercies, Lord
My mouth was made for worship
Since Jesus has pardoned all my sin
There is glory in my soul, I am happy now
I have found a perfect joy, nothing ever can destroy
I've flitted to a new address
I have a home that's waiting yonder
When life's sun has gone down into rest
O how much I'd like to go
My wayward life my shame has been
My only comfort in life and in death
Lord, how can one so vile
My only plea, He died for me!
I will sing for ever of your love, O Lord
My peace I give unto you
'My peace I leave with you.' this is His promise
As a golden sun that's setting
My people close attention give
My people, give ear, attend to my word
O'er a trackless sea I'm sailing
Blessed Pilot of my soul
Pilot me Saviour in sunshine
My pleading cries, eternal father, hear
When I ope my eyes at morning
Lord not for worldly wealth I pray
I pray, O Father, take my hand
Dear Lord to Thee I humbly pray
Hear my pray'r, O blessed Saviour, while I tarry
I'll whisper softly now to God
As the thirsty earth looks to heaven
My prayer to the promise shall cling
Oh, Master from Thy throne divine
My precious Lord has won my heart
The great I am told Moses
We have sweet consolation while on our pilgrim way
O how many precious promises were spoken by our Lord
My race is run; my warfare's o'er
I have a Redeemer, O worship his name
My Redeemer is the "Man of Sorrows"
My Redeemer, let me be
I know He rescued my soul
I know not why the leaves put forth in spring
In your justice save me
Jesus, Savior, to thy side
I cling to the Savior wherever I go
My reigns, my fabricâ€™s every part
Jesus sought and found me, Weary and distressed
He only is my Rock and my Salvation
There is One all unseen I cherish
I have a safe retreat in Jesus my King
My sands of life are running fast
Jesus, Thou art ever near me
My Savior dear with thorn-crowned head
When the way is dark and drear and the clouds hang low
My Savior for me bled
Jesus, my soul's abiding joy
O wondrous thought, that he should care
My Savior, how Thy soul was awed
My Savior, I am thine
My Savior! I behold Thy life
My Savior is abiding, abiding in my heart
When I walk through the valley of shadow and gloom
When shadows darken the path I tread
Sometimes my path is dark and drear
My Savior loves me; my Savior loves me
My Savior, on the word of truth
My Savior said that I should be
When my soul was sore and bleeding
My Savior walks beside me, Along life's rugged way
My Savior whose infinite grace
When I'm weary and oh, so lonely and sad
When my work on earth is ended
With Jesus to guide me each step of the way
In the pathway of my journey
While I'm walking on my pilgrim journey, through this weary land here
I am in my Savior's highway traveling on
Thro' the day of toil and sorrow, when my weary heart doth fail
Down from His throne my Savior came
Like music, floating on the evening air
Oh, yes, I love my Saviour true
My Saviour and my Lord, to Thee I give
My Savior and my Lord, let our lips now acclaim Thee
My Saviour hanging on the tree
I can feel the presence of a precious Friend
In the lowlands of sin I was straying
My Saviour paid the debt for me
My Saviour guides my erring feet
My Saviour, what Thou didst of old
When life with me is ended and I must go
My Saviour's call I hear
My Saviour's hand is on the helm
How marvelous! how wonderful!
My Saviour's love was freely offered
I have heard my Saviour's voice
I hold a secret, dolly
This life to me has been a pleasure since I met my blessed Lord
Christ Jesus is my Shepherd
My Shepherd fills my every need:
My Shepherd is the Lord, my God
The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want
My Shepherd is the Lord, He every want doth fill
Into the valleys of blessing
The Lord my precious Shepherd is
My sin was very great
What a wondrous message in God's Word!
At God's right hand my Savior stands
My sins, my sins are remembered no more
My sins, my sins, my Savior!
My sins were as high as a mountain
My sky is clear, the light of God
My Son, give me thine heart
Within my heart a song, is ringing all day long
Thou, Whom seraphs joy in praising
My guilt has all been washed away
With praise o'erflowing, I'm homeward going
My song forever shall record
When dark is my path and dreary
My song is love unknown
Voices blending, never ending
I cannot keep from singing, the Praises of My God
My song shall be of him who died
My song shall be of Jesus
O the peace and joy that is mine today
My song will be for you forever
My sorrows, like a flood
My soul and spirit, filled with joy (Tate and Brady)
My soul, awake, thy rest forsake
My soul, awake, and render
My soul, be on thy guard
My sould before you prostrate lies
My soul, bless the Lord! The Lord is most great
My soul, bless the LORD! My God, you are great!
[My soul declares aloud]
My soul don't delay
[My Soul Doth Magnify the Lord]
My soul doth magnify the Lord
My soul doth magnify the Lord
My soul doth magnify the Lord
My soul doth wait on God
My soul, exalt the Lord thy God
[My Soul Exalts and Magnifies the King]
My soul finds rest in God alone
[My Soul Finds Rest In the Lord God]
My soul followeth hard after thee
My Soul for Help on GOD relies
My soul, for help on God relies, From him alone, my safety flows
My soul for your salvation yearns and faints
My soul, give praise to the Lord
My soul gives glory to the Lord
My soul glorifies the Lord
My soul has a song since Jesus came in
My soul has found the sure foundation
My soul her song shall raise
I am walking now along the gospel way
My soul in deep that calls to deep
My soul in silence waits for God
O Lord of Light, our only hope of glory
My soul is athirst for God
My soul is beset With grief and dismay
Before I found my Savior I had a load of care
My path resounds with gladness
My soul is immersed in a fountain of love
Lord, you know that my heart is not proud
All this world, its wealth and honor,
My soul is sinking down to dust
Like the deer that yearns for water
My soul is thirsting for the living God
[My soul is thirsting for you]
Like a dry weary land without water
My soul, Jehovah bless; my God
[My Soul Lifts Up]
My soul loves Jesus
[My Soul Magnifies the Lord]
And the glory, the glory of the Lord
His mercy extends to all who fear him
My soul, now praise thy Maker!
My soul, praise the Lord, O God, Thou art great (Bridges)
The Mighty One works great things in me
[My Soul Proclaims God's Greatness]
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
My soul proclaims your glory, Lord
My soul proclaims your greatness, Lord
My soul pursues no vulgar theme
My soul rejoices
My soul proclaims your mighty deeds
My soul, repeat his praise
My soul rests only on her mighty God
I have heard of a mansion That is brighter than the sun
My soul, survey thy happiness
My soul was glad when unto me
How sweet it will be at the close of life's day
My soul, with grateful thoughts of love
My soul with patience waits
My soul would fain indulge a hope
Before I'd stay in hell one day
I follow the footsteps of Jesus, my Lord
My spirit on Thy care
My Spouse! in whose presence I live
My stedfast heart, O God
My Sunday School, the happy place
Nearer to Thee, my Saviour
I have giv'n my heart to Jesus
I was once far away from the Savior
My theme is loveâ€”redeeming love
My thoughts address your throne
My times are in thy hand
I can not see my earthly way
[My Tongue is the Disciples' Tongue]
I have a treasure in my heart
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
Sometimes my heart is longing for a Friend
I am thinking today of the friends I once knew
When worldly cares and troubles roll
Whatever may befall me, I am in His keeping
My trust is in you, O Lord: you are my God
When skies are blue and days are fair
Down in my heart I have a sweet melody
I have a vision of home I know, where living waters flow
My voice, O God, in my prayer hear
Oft amid life's toil and care
I am so happy as I travel on my way
My wonderful Lord, my wonderful Lord
I'm in love with Jesus now, He is my all in all
You may not have much of life's pleasures
O I have a precious friend
I've left the sins of Egypt, I'm bound for Canaan's land
My yoke, saith Christ, upon you take
[Myrrh-Bearing Mary]
Great God of providence! thy ways
O beautiful Hawaii Nei
Nada sÃ© sobre el futuro
Nae pyÅngsaeng sowÅn ikotppun (This is my one, my life-long wish)
Naermere dig, min Gud
Nag-yaa-ra-jyu-na!
There was One who was willing to die in my stead
They are nailed to the cross
Nailed to the cross, the Savior dies
Fair Hawaii, land of rainbows
Why do you linger, why do you stay
Narrow is the way to the goal
Long has divine compassion strove
Nations, clap your hands
Nations, that long in darkness walked
Silent, in the chill of midnight
Nature, she shows her weeping eyes
Nay, I cannot let thee go
Near the Cross her vigil keeping
There is a place of quiet rest
Keep me near to Thee, dear Savior
Nearer, O my blessed Saviour
Nearer to that happy home
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee,  Through word and sacrament
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart
Oh, sweet is the thought that ever is mine
The Lord is my light and the strength of my life
Nearer, still nearer, close to my Lord
Draw near, O Christ, to me
Ho! reapers of life's harvest
Tho' I am a pilgrim and a stranger here
Nearer to thee, nearer to thee
When I think about going to heaven, how I rejoice
I am pressing along in the love-lit way
Nearing the homeland, that beautiful shore
I am nearing the port, I will soon be at home
Nears the ending of the day
[Need You Now]
Lost on the pathway of sin's bitter nightfall
Dwell in the One who raised Christ from the dead
Neither death, nor life
[Neither Desert Wind Nor Sun]
By the crowd of worshippers
There is never a day so sunny
Never a prayer he will not answer
Never again, Noah
Since I have found my redeemer and friend
Walking life's path I know not a fear
The Queen of Crunk jumps out and I step in the booth
I'll never cease to love Him, blest Lamb of Calvary
God of every tribe, every language
Never fear! He is near!
Never further than thy cross
With the word of God to guide us
I had wandered far away in sin
You called out, into darkness
Never in all human story
Lead me, my Savior, Lead me thro' this world of care
Never leave me, though I grieve Thee
Never let Jesus into your heart
Weary of sin, heavy laden soul
Tho' often cast down in Thy soul
In the fight, say, does your heart grow weary?
We have known the grace of Jesus
Onward, O soldier, anew to begin
Unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth
Never to be remembered any more
I have a cross that I must bear
Never will I part with Christ
Why dost thou carry a burden of sin
Strive to make yourself a blessing
Eternal God, today is a day of new beginnings.
Come join us now as we dream and plan our lives
Come ev'ry soul beneath the sky
New every morning is the love
God shapes and forms us from the dust
The Son of God, our Savior
New life in Christ
[New Light Has Dawned]
I've got a new name over in glory
New songs of celebration render
[New Testament Song]
New truths are no surprise to God
It's like there was a miracle 
New Year bells are gaily ringing
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!
Once more the constant sun, revolving round his sphere
O brothers, how the years roll on
O Lord, by thy supporting hand
Newborn of God, his glory manifest
I believe in one God, the Father almighty
[Nicodemus Comes By Night]
When the day declineth
Night, and a storm, and hearts with sore affright
Night has closed the gates
Night has drawn its curtains
Night has fallen
Night! how I love thy silent shades
Night is o'er
Night of peace
Cold are the people, winter of life
Night of wonder, night of glory
All living souls shall bless Thy name
Except the Lord the house doth make
We do not know, and can not tell
Oft times I must carry a wearisome load
No burning heats by day
No cheers for David, no cheers for Goliath
No common vision this I see
[No Condemnation]
There is now no condemnation, to the souls which are in Christ
No cross for me, O blessed Lord and Savior?
There'll be no dark river and no valley of doubt
Words are ringing, comfort bringing, life some tender, sweet refrain
There's no disappointment in Jesus
[No Eye Has Seen]
[No Eye Has Seen]
Christ stood before Pilate with fettered hands
[No Fear of God Before the Eyes]
There is not a friend like Jesus
Oh my blessed Saviour dear, come and be thou very near
Jesus was trav'ling a dusty highway
"No God for me!" the fool exclaims
As the Father has loved me
Oh, have you heard the story
On the night on which our Savior was betrayed
In every town and city, some people can be found
No heav'nly fire--What city's night
Went to the rocks for to hide my face
[No Iron Spike, No Granite Weight]
No longer Jew or Greek, no longer slave or free--
No longer, Lord, do Thou despise me
No longer now, as once we were
No longer now at Eden's gate
No longer of him be it said, He hath no place to lay his head
You unravel me, with a melody
We once were lost
"No more the curse," O Christ, we praise Thee
No more be still, just God; no more delay
No more beneath th' oppressive hand
No more festivals! No fasting!
Where life's crystal stream doth flow
I'll give you  a piece of good news today
HAVE we not known it, have we not heard it
No more shall the sound of the war-whoop be heard
No need to sing the same notes
No night in Heaven! O blessed thought
Shadows never darken heaven
There will be no night in heaven
In the land of fadeless day
Long is the way of the earthly life
No, no, it is not dying
If on some bright and pleasant day
No, not despairingly come I to thee
No, not my power, but thine, O Lord
There's no one to go to but Jesus
What would I do without Jesus
No-one but You, Lord
He's the One I love
Who can relieve us of burdens we bear
I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus 
There's no one ever loved me like Jesus
No one has ever seen God
We sing of the birth in a lorn little town
No one knows the day or hour
Jesus walked this road before me
Christ is the best of all
There's no one like my Savior, No friend can be like him
No one has loved me like Jesus
No one understands like Jesus
There is no other Friend like Jesus
No other name but the name of Jesus
One offer of salvation
No other name so dear to me
No other name but Jesus
Before the mercy seat I plead
In realms above the mists of time
There will be no parting pain
O sinner, come home to the Savior
No pen can write that sweet delight
No regrets, no regrets for the work I may have done
No righteousness of mine
No rod of vengeance Jesus takes
No room for Jesus, the world is so wide
Was there no room in Bethlehem
No room in all the city on that holy night
No room in the inn for the travelers weary
When the Lord was born that day
No saint on earth lives life to self alone
Shadows of sorrow often fall on our way
No shadows yonder, All light and song
There is no shelter for the soul
No songs of triumph now be sung
There'll be no sorrow on love's tomorrow
There is no night in heaven
I am going over yonder to that homeland of the soul
In tender compassion He sought me
No temple now, no gift of price
[No Temptation Has Seized You]
You have heard of the sweet Rose of Sharon
With Godâ€™s Shekinah glory filled
You have time for seeking earth's treasures
No tramp of soldiers' marching feet
No weapon formed, or army or king
No weight of gold or silver
No wind at the window
Now, you can't stop the Spirit, it will blow where it will
When I am worn by the cares of the day
Nobody knows the burdens I bear
Have I burdens hard to bear?
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Nobody knows the trouble I see, Lord!
When I am burdened with my grief, and loving hands
Would you care if some friend you have met day by day
Nobody's a nobody, believe me 'cause it's true
Ev'ry day I am writing a record
'Tis the day, the blessed day
Grudge not to see the wicked men
Not unto us Lord not to us, But to thy Name give praise
Non nobis, Domine! Not unto us, O Lord
O the wondrous love of Jesus
None else but Thee, for evermore
None is like God, who reigns above,
None is like Jeshurun's God
None lacks a friend who hath thy love
When you need a friend to guide you
None other Lamb, none other name
Jesus is the only Saviour
Nonviolence may take a long time
Learning to read and learning to write
Nor reason, nor sense
Not a friend but Jesus
Trusting in Jesus, counting the blessings
[Not Alone, but Two by Two]
Not alone where silent woodlands
Not always will trouble beset us
When you need someone to help you in the time of grief and care
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
Lead our hearts away from worldly gain
[Not By Might nor Power]
Not by the brazen trumpet's voice
Not by Thy mighty hand
Not by wrestling, but by clinging
Beyond the stars we'll meet again
Not far beyond the sea, nor high
Not far, not far from the kingdom, Yet in the shadow of sin
It isn't very far to heaven
Not for our sins alone
Not for ourselves, O Lord, not for ourselves
Not for the pious dead we weep
Not made for the trifling things of time
Not for tongues of heaven's angels
I cannot tell how wonderful
Not haughty is my heart
Not here, as to the prophet's eye
Not here for high and holy things
Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted
Not I, but Christ, Not I, but Christ
Who will be drunkards bye and bye
Not in anger, mighty God
Not in anger smite us, Lord
Not in Jerusalem alone
Not in the deep contrition
Not in the hour of death
It tarries long, and seems to say
Thou dost not trust in vain
Christ went a building to prepare
Not my own! redeemed by Jesus
Not my own, for Jesus bought me
Not of terrestrial mortal themes
So shall we sing, the changeful story
Not one step more, Heavenly Father
Not only on Sunday
Not saved, and so near to the kingdom of God
Ere Christ will reign within thy heart
Not so in haste, my heart
Not so many more days my spirit stays
Not the powerful, not the privileged
Not to ourselves, O God, we ask a name
Not to Sinai's dreadful blaze
Not to the Mount that burn'd with fire
Not to the strong is the battle, nor to the swift is the race
Not to us be glory given
Not to us, Lord, not to us
"Not tonight," so many say
"Not tonight" said the youth
Not unto us, not unto us be glory, Lord
Not unto us Lord; not to us
Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Thy great name
Not unto us, O LORD of heaven
Not what my hands have done
March with us! 
Not with naked eye
Not worthy, Lord! to gather up the crumbs
Not yet is the summer ended
Nothing between my soul and my Savior
Jesus was passing by one day
What can wash away my sin?
What can sweetly fill my soul
Jesus, see me at thy feet, Nothing but Thy blood can save me
Nothing but leaves, Nothing but leaves
Nothing distress you
Nothing fair on earth I see
Nothing in all creation
[Nothing in this World]
Nothing into this world we brought
Nothing is impossible
Do not be afraid, God has called you by your name
Nothing satisfies but Jesus
God did not spare His only Son
Nothing to bring, O Savior King
Nothing to pay! ah, nothing to pay!
There's nothing too hard for Thee
There is nothing too precious for Jesus
Nothing was too dear for you, Lord
Nothing's heavy with lots of hands
Now a mighty tree has fallen
Now all give thanks to God
Now let the vault of heaven resound
Now all the woods are sleeping
Now all the woods are sleeping
Now ancient shadows flee
Now are the days fulfilled
Now are we sons of God
Now as we gather, God's chosen people
We thank You, Lord, now as we pray
Now at last I end this strife
Now at the Lambâ€™s imperial feast
Now at this evening hour
Now be thou praised, O Christ Jesu
[Now Before the Throne]
Now behold Him dying
Now behold the Lamb
Now bells are ringing far and wide
Now blessed be the LORD
Now blessed be the Lord our God
Now Christ is risen
Now Christ, the sinless Son of God
Now come, ye Christians all and bring
Now dawns the Sun of righteousness
Now dies in David's city
Now don't you let the troubles of tomorrow
Now doth the sun ascend the sky
Now doth the truth appear
Now, even now, I yield, I yield
[Now Evening Comes to Close the Day]
Now ev'ry child that dwells on earth
Now fades all earthly splendor
Now fain my joyous heart would sing
Now for each yearning heart
Now forward with courage, on to victory
Now found is the fairest of Roses, 'Mongst briars it sweetly reposes
Now from his cradle comes the child
Now from the altar of my heart
Now from the garden to the cross
[Now, from the Heav'ns Descending]
Now give thanks, ye old and young
Now give us pilgrims water flowing
Now glad of heart be ev'ryone!
Now glory be to God
Now glows the morn in beauty rare
[Now go forward]
[Now Go in Peace]
Now God be with us, for the night is closing
Now, God of Light, the morn appears
Now hail the day so rich in cheer
Now hail we our Redeemer
How oft I prayed for power
Now He will save you, now He will bless
Now Holy Spirit, ever one
Now hush your cries, and shed no tear
Tenderly calleth the Savior
Jesus, my Lord, will love me forever
I have heard the gentle pleading
Now I have found the firm foundation
[Now I Know]
Death could never hide your love
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pullen)
Now I resolve with all my heart
Once I sang the worldly songs
Now in holy convocation
Now in reverence and awe
Now in the name of him, who sent
You who have touched us and graced us with love
[Now In View of All God's Mercies]
[Now Is Christ Risen]
Now is Christ risen from the dead
Now is Jesus, now is Jesus
Break open your hearts of stone
Now is the healing time decreed
Now is the saintâ€™s salvation come
Lo the golden fields of harvest wait today
Spirit of love, crush the pain of hatred
[Now Is the Time, The Time of God's Favor]
We are nearing eternity's side of the grave
Now it's time to rest, like robins in the nest
Now Jericho had walls of stone
Now Jesus at the door is knocking
Now join we to praise the creator
Now know we not the meaning of life's sorrow
Now lay we calmly in the grave
Now let a true ambition rise
Now let all loudly
Now let me gain perfection's height
Now let our mourning hearts revive
Now let the Father and the Son
Now let the heavens be joyful

Now let us all, in hymns of praise
Now let us all with one accord Sing praises to our gracious Lord

Now rest beneath night's shadows, Man, beast, wood, town and meadows

Of mercy and of judgement
Of mercy and of justice
Of mercy, Lord, of judgment, I will sing
Of mercy's never failing spring
Of my life the life, O Jesus
Of steadfast love and justice, LORD
Happy were the children brought unto the Lord
Why should they such pain e'er give Thee
Of the Father's heart begotten
Of the Father's love begotten
Of the glorious body telling
The time is very near
Of thee, Jehovah, is our singing
Of Thy love some gracious token
Of Twofold Natures, Christ, the Giver
Of Zion's honor angels sing
Offended with our crimes, O holy God
The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love
If you're offering just anything
Dear God, our gifts we gladly bring
Now come and sing a happy song
O Thou Who gavest all for me
Out of Thy bounty Lord we give
Oft has my youthful mind been led
Oft have I sat in secret sighs
Oft have we passed the guilty night
Oft I read with sweet delight
Oft in danger, oft in woe
Often had I heard the story
From the mountains to the valleys
O I'm not ashamed of Jesus my King
Oh blest the house, whate'er befall
Oh Bodhidharma sits on P'u-t'o Isle
Where hast thou built thine house
Oh, charge the waves to bear our friends
Oh, Chester, have you heard about Harry?
Oh child do not despair
Oh, come, all ye faithful
Oh come, all ye faithful, triumphantly sing
O come, little children, O come, one and all (Brueckner)
Oh, don't go away without Jesus
Oh, Earth! throughout thy borders
Oh! for a closer walk with God
Glory to the Lamb
Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
Oh, for a faith that will not wait
Oh, freedom! Oh, freedom!
We're living in the end of time
Oh! give me Lord my sins to mourn
I'm happy with Christ my Lord today, since He in love has come in to stay
Oh God, eternal friend and guide
Oh, happy day when we shall stand
The voice of Jesus calls to thee
At set of sun when life is oâ€™er
There is a home beyond the tide
Oh, how are you living, my brother?
Oh how blessed, faithful souls, are ye
Oh how blest are ye behond our telling
Oh how could I forget Him
Oh, how He loves to have us near
Oh, how I love my Jesus! He saved me from my sin
Oh, how joyfully
Did ever you see the like before
Oh! I want to see my Jesus once more
Oh, I was made for this
Oh, I'm satisfied with Jesus in my heart
O joy of joys, God so did love
Oh, let thy spirit with us tarry, Lord Jesus, this we ask of Thee
O list to the call, He is yearning for thee
Oh Lord, How perfect is your name
Oh loved! but not enoughâ€”though dearer far
Oh, Master, blessÃ¨d Master
Oh! may I worthy prove to see
Oh, may the Spirit of all grace
Oh merciful Creator! Hear
Oh more than merciful! whose bounty gave
Some glad day, some glorious morning, when all cares and troubles are o'er
Oh, my blessed Savior
Oh, my Lord Jesus, if I did not have You
Oh! my soul, bless thou Jehovah!
Even though I walk through the valley
O golden day, O day of God
Pass me not by, my Saviour!
Oh! praise the LORD with Hymns of Joy
Easter jubilation fills the streets and towns
Oh rejoice, ye Christians, loudly
Oh, Resurrection Day!
Oh, praise again with gladsome songs
Oh, sing jubilee to the Lord
O sing, my soul, your Maker's praise
Oh! sing with me of social spheres
Oh Spirit of the light and love
I came to Alabama wid My banjo on my knee
Oh, tell to all the peoples
Oh, that I had a thousand voices, They should be raised to Christ my Lord!
Oh that my life may henceforth be
Oh, the Cross, the Saviour dying
Weary gleaner in the field, poor or plenty be the yield
Oh, the eyes of Christ the Lord
How I wish I could tell it, what Jesus did for me
Years I wandered, freely squandered all my substance day by day
Oh, the glory of Your presence
There's a Friend that's ever near us
Oh the love that us redeemed!
Oh, the mercy of God
Oh, the presence of the Saviour
[Oh thou that tellest good tidings to Zion]
Oh! thou, whose tender mercy hears
Oh to be kept by Jesus
Oh, to love Thee, precious Jesus
She came to Jesus, one of old
Oh! Valiant-for-the-Truth
I've come to wash my soul in the living water
Oh weep not oâ€™er thy childrenâ€™s tomb
Oh well for him who all things braves
There's three gates in-a the East
Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh, what a beautiful day
What a day of great rejoicing, happy praises we'll be voicing
I read of a city over the way
Oh, what a happy lot is mine
Oh, what are you doing for Jesus
O what has Jesus done for me, he came from the land of Canaan
Oh, what He's done for me
I wonder sometimes what heaven must be
Oh when shall I see Jesus
Oh, when will the period appear
Oh, who can know the mind of God
Oh, why, by furious rage combined
Oh, why should I wander a stranger from Thee
Oh, wonderful cleansing
Jesus came down from heavenly mansions, just to redeem a sinner like me
Oh would I had a thousand tongues
Oh would, my God, that I could praise Thee
Oh wouldst Thou in Thy glory come
Oh, yes, I'm saved, and I know it
OjalÃ¡ that luck will come
Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Long ago when but a boy, at old camp-meeting time
Back in the days of old there was a man we're told
Nebuchadnezzar came marching with his great hosts of the Lord
Way down upon the Swanee River
Old Glory! we love thee
Some day, I know not when â€™twill be
I was lost in sin and sorrow
They were in an upper chamber, They were all with one accord
When the old-time preachers start to preach God's Word
[Old Year, Take Off My Temper]
[Older Brother, Older Brother]
The Lord, how fearful is his name
Omnipotent King, who reignest on high
Omnipotent, Lord, my Savior and king
Lord, how shall wretched sinners dare
Walking on cobblestones
[On a Mount Exceeding High]
Children can you truly tell
On a sunny day are you smiling
It pleased the Lord to bruise his only Son on Calvary
One day to me a message came
Lord Jesus, now at Thy request
On Calvary our Savior died
My Savior came from heav'n above
O Lord I pray, remember me
Shall I tell you who will come to Bethlehem on Christmas Morn
On Christmas night all Christians sing
On Christ's ascension I now build
You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord
On earth has dawned this day of days
On earth we meet again below
On Eden's primal day
[On Eden's Wedding Day the World]
Eternal love the darling song
On Friday, when the sky was dark
On Galilee's high mountain
On God alone my soul relies
On God most high be blessings poured
Here the mysteries of life overwhelm us
On great Jehovah who in faith rely
Sometime we shall play
On His pilgrimage of woe
On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
I am happy ev'ry day, as I travel on my way
On many a favored vineyard
On Mary, Virgin undefiled
Kind souls, reflect awhile with me
On my heart imprint Your image
I went to the valley, I didn't go to stay
I am moving onward ev'ry passing day
On Olivet a little band
On, On to Victory, the trumpet call is sounding
Jesus Christ, the Lord's anointed
Forward today, with our hearts aglow
On our span-long pilgrimage
On our way rejoicing
On Pentecost they gathered
How good, how sweet it all can be
Lord of my life to thee my powers belong
On some wonderful, happy morning I shall behold my Savior's face
On that day the Lord shall be One
On that great day of judgment, what will you say?
Often we have disappointments here as we trudging thru this old world
On that glory hallelujah morning when we hear the blessed Savior's call from heaven
Soon my Lord will come again to earth
Oh, my hopes grow fonder of a home up yonder
The wolf is the guest of the lamb
When I wake up in the morning on the judgment day
On the altar I abide
Lo! the God by whom salvation
I am standing on the bank of the river
At the close of the day, and the setting of sun
On the banks where Jordan rolled
Men have fought for fame and glory, some for gold and silver, too
On the beach, the waves of waters
On the bright celestial shore
All my fears are gone
O Jesus, I'm lost in Thy sight
[On the Cross of Calvary]
When the fierce north wind with his airy forces
On the day of Pentecost
On the Day of Pentecost
On the day of resurrection
Up the chalky path we wander
When the weary march is over we shall find the promised rest
On the first Christian Sabbath eve
To show each one that wants to know, the way of God
On the first Thanksgiving day
I am pressing onward with the King of kings
On the glory-road to yonder glad abode
I am on the glory road
At the hallelujah meeting, over on the golden shore
On the golden streets of glory I will meet you some sweet day
On the good and faithful
There's a song of joy in my heart today
On the green branches in the dim forest
O the Glory Hallelujah
On the hills of glory land
Won't we have a happy time, when we reach that sunny clime
Let us walk on the hilltops of blessing
I am going home to glory and I'm on my way there now
Behold the Lamb that once was slain
Hark! my soul, the trumpet sounding
On the mountain the wind bloweth mild
Lord, break me on this mountain top
On the mountain top above the world below
On the mountain's top appearing
On the new Jerusalem
There's a grand old church in a country town
Oh, what glory that will be, when we cross the rolling sea
Many are the lonely hearts, in this world below
On the other side is a land of wonder
On the other side of the hour of trial
We are marching on the path to glory
On the poor, on the poor
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound, Grace that saved a wretch like me
On the road of happiness, on the road of love
Come on my brother we will shout and sing
My bark was on a stormy sea
Once my soul was sinking, neath a load of care
Are you building on the Rock of Ages? 
On the Rock of Thy Commandments
Gladly I am singing, cheeful is my ode
On the Savior cast thy burden
We are on the shining road to the glory land
We are going away on the Special train
Hail to thy brightness, glorious sun
On the tide of His love I am borne every hour
On the victory side
Let us shout and sing hallelujah
I've started to a country beyond the reach of night
I have left the vales of darkness and the stormy plains of sin
I am singing as I go thru this sinful world below
As the eagle lifts her wings
On Thee, great God, we still attend
On thee, O God of purity
On this day of celebration
With this bread and wine we come
On this day, the first of days
On this glorious Easter morning
On this, God's holy day
On this good earth, God's generous creation
On this high feast day honour we the Baptist
On this morn we see the dawning
On this my patient soul I stay
On this night, most holy, in circumstance lowly
On this our day of praise
Jesus calls for soldiers brave and true and strong
Christian, keep thine armor bright
Turning thy face from all the past,
There's a goodly land lying on before
Christian, gird the armor on
Hark! hark, the trumpet sounding
Jesus is calling the brave and the faithful
THE Lord's command to go into the world and preach the gospel unto all
On what has now been sown
On wings of faith, ye thoughts, fly hence
On wings of living light
Once I was a poor lost sinner, but the Saviour heard my cry
On wings of morning our prayers and devotions are soaring
Songs of praise we now can sing
On throâ€™ the Easter sunlight
On your right stands the Queen in garments of gold
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
Once again the olden story
Once again we come to the house of God,
Once from a European shore
Once He came, how meek and lowly
Once he came in blessing
Once I said, "I must keep quiet"
Once I was blind, now I can see
Once in royal David's city
Once in royal David's city, When the king was in distress
Once in the blest baptismal waters
Once Jesus loved a rich man with a question in his heart
Once more before we part
Once more from rest I rise again
Once more, O Lord, Thy sign shall be
Once more our grateful, strengthened hearts
Once more the daylight shines abroad
Once more the shadows lengthen
Once more the solemn season calls
Once more to Bethany,
Once more, to pay our annual vows
Once, O Lord, thy garden flourished
Once, only once, and once for all
Once the angel started back
Once the Lord, for our salvation
Once thou didst on earth appear
Once to every man and nation
Once to our world there came
Once we sang and danced with gladness
[Once When Jesus Christ Was Hungry]
[One Among You Will Betray Me]
One awful word which Jesus spoke 
[One Beyond All]
Gentile or Jew, servant or free
One by one we're passing over, One by one we cross the tide
Our Lord gave himself
Living He loved me
One day, a wayward boy
Lord, make today one day for thee
One day when heaven was filled with his praises
Nearer home, nearer home, I am one day nearer home
One day, the news was grim
One day there'll be new earth and Heaven, for the first will soon pass away
One day to the Lord
One door and only one
[One Faith, One Hope, One Lord]
Creator Lord, almighty Father
One finger, one thumb, one hand
[One Flock, One Shepherd]
[One God]
All the gifts that God has given
For there is one God and one mediator between God and men
One God
One God, one living God
One grand day, yes it was one grand day
One holy church of God appears
One holy night in Bethlehem
There is grace and mercy waiting me
One human family God has made
One human pair, and only one
We'd fished all night for nothng
There is one I can trust when I need a friend
One is the body and one is the Head
Gather, disciples, your master to meet
One look at Jesus, and He settled it all for me
Give us new hands, open and free
Is not this bread we share
Loved ones will weep o'er my silent face
One more day, one more day
One more day of service ends
One more day's work for Jesus
One named Lazarus was sick
One of these days, it won't be long
I looked about one mornin', and thru a misty sky
Sorrow and sighing all will be ended, voices and hearts in love will be blended
One prayer I have, all prayers in one
One is the race of mankind under sin's condemnation
One Sacred Trinity!
One sacrifice of Christ
One shall tell another
When warâ€™s shrill blast abroad is heard
One small Child in a land of a thousand
One sole baptismal sign
One song of praise, one voice of prayer
One special night, one holy night
One star above all stars
It would not do for me to know
Did you ever journey afar from home
One sweetly solemn thought
One there is, above all others
One there is who loves thee
I thank thee, Lord, that I can cast
[One thing I know]
One thing I of the Lord desire
One thing is needful! Let me deem
Your love never fails
One thing, with all my soul's desire
One thing's needful; Lord, this treasure
One, two, three, Jesus loves me
One was old, another barren
[One Wedding Dress Long Put Away]
In a dream I saw a city
One who is all unfit to count
What though the dark cloud for a season doth hover
[One With God Before Creation]
[One Woman None Could Heal]
One wonderful day Christ Jesus the King
One word when my heart is o'erwhelmed with its sin
Only a boy named David
This life is so short, like a flower we fade
Only a look at Jesus
O, ye who mourn and ye who sigh
Only a messenger, yet ready am I
The love we have for you, O Lord
Naught have I gotten but what I received
Only a step to Jesus From your sin and shame
When we gaze at the dimples of childhood
Somewhere a voice is calling
Only a touch of the tremulous hand
Heaven's not far away, so I've oft been told
Only a word for the Master
Only a word, if spoken in love
Only at the cross is peace
Only-begotten Word of God eternal
Jesus Christ is now among [amongst] us
[Only By Grace]
Oh, there's many a loss on the way of the cross
No one knows what my fate will be
When the Savior in his glory
Trust in him at all times
Only in God is my soul at rest
Only Jesus would I know
O how lonely without Jesus
Only Jesus, always Jesus!
If on the topmost point
Our God a firm foundation
Like gentle showers feed thirsty flowers
Only one intention, only one ambition
Only one prayer today
Only Thee can I trust through life's shadows
The sweetest songs I fain would offer
All but this is loss
Come, ev'ry soul by sin oppressed
You may build great cathedrals large or small
Where Jesus is, there all is bright
O God, our rock and haven
When storm winds blow and clouds made dark my day
Onward to the fight
The clarion call is ringing clear
"Onward and upward to my Father's home"
Onward, children, onward
Onward, Christian soldiers
Onward, Christian! though the region
Whither are you going, pilgrims of a day
There's a mighty army marching forward
Ye children of the heavenly King
Onward, comrades, in the Master's name
Trav'lers to a better land
We're enlisted in the army of our Savior and our King
We are marching onward at our Master's command
Star above to show the way
Light from heaven shines upon my way
Onward to Zion, faithful and strong
Onward, upward here we go
In His love rejoicing, God's praise still voicing
Ye loyal soldiers of Jehovah, marching on for the right
We are in the service of our blest Redeemer
Open anew Thy fountain of grace
[Open are the gifts of God]
Open, Lord, my inward ear
Open my eyes, Lord. Help me to see your face
Open my eyes, that I may see
Open my heart to Thy love blessed Saviour
Open now Thy gates of beauty
Open, open up the window
To the ones brokenhearted
Open our eyes, dear Lord
Open our eyes Lord, we want to see Jesus
Open our eyes, O Lord, we pray
Hear the blessed Savior calling
Open the door of your heart tonight
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the gates of righteousness
Open the windows of Heaven
Open their minds to know you, Lord
Open Thou mine eyes
Live not as to thyself alone
Glory to God for His sunshine is free
Open the door of your heart, dear child
We waited for this day
Open wide the church's door!
Open wide the doors to Christ
Open wide the gate of heaven
Open wide the windows of your soul today
Open wide, ye everlasting doors
Open your ears, O faithful people
Open Your Heart and let Him in
Open your heart, open your heart
Open your heart to Jesus
Open your hearts, all you who hear this
Open your mouth and praise the Lord!
There is a fountain open for my cleansing
Holy God! Fill us this day with new breath!
Bless us we pray, all thru the day
Oppressed with unbelief and sin
Or if, on joyful wing
Thou Christ alone art great
A stream of mercy springs
Our natural and our federal head
Trust in the Savior as onward you go
Others he saved, himself he cannot save
Our flag has the blue of the heavens
As we gather today in our bright Sabbath home
Holy Jesus! have you known Him?
Our banner is thâ€™ eternal God
Hear ye the Master's call,
Our master to obey
Let us do our best for Jesus
The Father gave his only Son
Our blessed bond of union
Our blessed Savior sev'n times spoke
How shall I return to God
How can we make a return
How shall I make a return to God
Our bondage it shall end, by and by
O there is a home where the soul can repose
We have a dauntless Captain
Our cause if heav'n's high king (may Israel say)
Our cheerful voices let us raise
Standing forth on life's rough way
Our children, Lord, in faith and prayer
Our church now is self-reliant
Our cities cry to you, O God
While pressing on life's lonely road
Our common home, this planet earth
We ought to be proud of our glorious land
Our country's voice is pleading
Long ago in days of Moses
Our home is so lonely since our darling is gone
Our day of praise is done
The ocean waves roll wide and deep
Our earth we now lament to see
Our evening prayers attend
Our eyes are on the Lord
Our eyes have seen the glory
Our faithful God makes plans which cannot fail

Our God, he is a God of might
There is, beyond the azure blue
Our God is a rock in a weary land
Weary soul, do not despair
Our God is All in all
Here in this time, here in this place
Our God is lifted up midst the shouts of joy
When Israel camped in Sinai, then Moses heard from God:
Our God is Love, unchanging Love
There is work that each one may do, Jesus calls for me and for you
Our God is mighty, worthy of all praising
Our God is merciful. God's gentle kindness knows no end
Our God is so great, so strong and so mighty
Our God loves us, His love will never end

Our gracious God has laid his firm foundations
Our gracious God sent the Savior
We are gathered on convention day, singing all the while
Come boldly to the throne of grace, Whatever thy want may be
Our King completely satisfies
Jesus! What a Friend for sinners
Our guilt do we confess today
Our hearts grow warm with holy fire
Our hearts shall triumph in the Lord
Our hearts this day remember

Our help is in the name of God the LORD

At evening when shadows are length'ning for me
Happy saints are singing, glory bells are ringing
When Jesus was here, and walked among men
Our hope, if we will find it, is in Christ
Our hope, our life are in the Lord
Our house is the place I love best
Our hunger cries from plenty, Lord
Our hymn of thanks we sing today
Walking, walking, walking with Jesus life's rugged way
Our king is coming back to reign
Christ's everlasting gospel is ringing out again
For he smiled down upon my littleness
Our Lamb has conquered: let us follow him
Our land for Christ we sing
Our life how short! a groan, a sigh
Our life in the Spirit, our path on the Way
Our lives are filled with sorrows
Our lives must count, their work must show
Our Lord and God, O bless this day
Over the earth glad songs are ringing
Our Lord, his passion ended
Soon our Lord is coming again
O, I am looking for the coming of my blessed Lord and King
I have read how the Lord
God's word has told us of a coming great event
Our Lord is risen from the dead
The Lord unto his Christ has said, In glory I enthrone thee
[Our Lord Reigns, May the Nations Quake in Fear]
Our Lord, you stood in Pilate's hall
Our Lord, You were seent to a place wild and vast
The angel of death has bereft us

We have lost our loving sister

How many in our favored land
Our mother is sleeping in Jesus today
A bright constellation illumines the sky
Thy church, O God, her heart to thee upraiseth
Hark! dear sinner, don't you hear?
Shadows soon will disappear
When Jesus hung upon the cross
Our Parent, by whose name
Our parents, brothers, sisters, friends
Friends of years with just one heart
Our Paschal Lamb, that sets us free
Christ yesterday and today (Jesucristo ayer y hoy)
Receive this hymn, our praise
Our praises, Lord, Thou dost not need
For balmy sunshine, for nourishing rain
To the Father's great broadcasting station
In that glory land of promise, over on the golden shore
From the throne His light shines o'er us
Jesus, thou Refuge of the soul
Our refuge and our strength is heav'n's high God
Our refuge is in God
Trust, trust the Lord, tho' in sadness
O thou Redeemer of our race
They crucified Him, the dear Lamb of God
Our Savior came that you and me
[Our Savior Christ Once Knelt in Prayer]
When we are troubled and distressed, and all around is much unrest
While trav'ling on the road down here so often we are prone to fear
Our Savior's infant cries were heard
What love our blessed Saviour showed while on Mount Calvary
Our Saviour's words are Watch and Pray:
With joyful hearts and songs of glee
Our schools are nurseries below
With a song of hope and peace and gladness
Awake and join the song of battle as we go
We sing to our Lord a new song 
Our soul shall magnify the Lord
Our souls are full of praises to you
Our souls are in his mighty hand
Our sov'reign Lord has universal sway
Our sov'reign Lord, the great Jehovah praise
Like Zion's steadfast mount are they
Our table now with food is spread
Our tithes and off'rings, Lord, we bring
Our tongues were made to bless the Lord
We're traveling on a journey here, from earth to a better land somewhere
Our troubles do abound
Our voice in song we gladly raise
Our voice would be a useless cry
Our whole salvation doth depend
Our wishes would our ruin prove
Our world belongs to God
Ours were the griefs he bore
Out from the rising of the sun
Out in the damp and cold
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd
Out in the dew and cold He stands
Out in the field, dear Master
[Out in the Wilderness]
Out of a heart of love
Out of ashes prayers are lifted
Out of Christ, without a Savior
Sinner, if you pass death's portal
Let us take the words you give
Out of darkness thro' marvelous grace
Let the darkness flee from here
Long in darkness we have waited
Out of the darkness, into the light
[Out of Darkness Let Light Shine]
Out of deep, unordered water
Father, like an orphaned child, I am tempted, oft beguiled
Out of joy and out of need
Out of my bondage, sorrow and night
OUT of my darkness God called me
Out of my sin and its bondage
Out of need and out of custom
[Out of our failure to create]
I've been lifted out of bondage into Canaan's land
Out of the deep I call to thee
Out of the deep I cry to Thee, O Lord God, hear my crying
Out of the deep I cry to Thee, My God, with heart's contrition
Out of the deeps of dark distress, The deeps of dark despairing
Out of the depths I cry to Thee, Lord mark my lamentation
Out of the depths, O God, we call to you
Out of the depths, in tender love
Out of the depths of my soul I cry
Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord!
Out of the depths I call
[Out of the Depths I Call You]
Out of the depths I cry to you on high
Out of the depths I cry, LORD
Out of the depths I cry to thee
Out of the depths I cry to Thee
Out of the depths I cry to thee
[Out of the Depths I Cry to You]
Out of the depths I cry to you
Out of the depths I cry to you
Out of the depths I cry to you
Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord please hear my call
Out of the depths of fear
[Out of the Depths of Hopelessness]
Out of the depths of sadness
Out of the depths of woe
Lord, hear my cry and see my case
Out of the heart of God
He took me out of the pit
Out of the shadow of death and the grave
Out on life's dark heaving ocean
Go and tell our neighbours
Out where the stars are born
Out with the reapers, to gather the harvest we haste away
Weak and sinful though we are
Outside the gate, and yet so near the fountain
Over and over I stood upon the shore
Over and over the Saviour has blessed me
Over and over, again and again
Over and over again
Over Bethl'em's hillside beamed a glorious star
When the toils of life are ended, And its sorrows wound no more
Over in Bethlehem one clear and shiv'ry night
I am a happy pilgrim, traveling home
Beyond cold Jordan's rolling strand
We are pressing onward day by day
Over in the land of eternal glory, by the crystal sea
Over in the land of glory we shall rest when day is done
I have come out of Egypt and its bondage drear
Over in the sunshine
In that country which lies over Jordan
Over Kedron Jesus treadeth
'Tis a long, rugged road up the pathway of life
Over my head I hear music in the air
When the golden sun sinks in the west
Tho' I've traveled thru the years, with my sorrow and my tears
There will be a great reunion
Over on the shining hills of glory, in that better brighter territory
Victory bells are ringing, angels sweet are singing
There is a home for you and me
Over the billows with Jesus we go
Over the chaos of the empty waters
O sinner, the Savior is calling for thee, Long, long has he called thee in vain (Moyer)
Over the earth is a mat of green
Over the fields the sunbeams are falling
I am but a weary pilgrim
The road I traveled yesterday
Over the river, beautiful river
Over the river, fields are all green
Over the river our loved ones now call
From afar in that city of light
Over the billows and ocean foam
Over the sea, over the sea
Over the stars, yes, o'er the beautiful stars
Oft when the sun is adorning
Over the sunset mountains
I'm so glad I have found the way leading to that eternal day
We are an army, great and grand, under our blessed Saviour's command
In a manger far away, Once the Prince of Glory lay
Over there love only dwelleth
When the toils of life are ended
Just beyond this vale of tears
When at last we cross the shining river
In that land of light and song, with the happy ransomed throng
Over trackless regions
I am going to that home
Seated above, enthroned in the Father's love
Now the darkness fades
Overflowing with the love of Jesus
O what a song of gladness is in my soul today
Now my soul is free from care, resting in green pastures fair
Overwhelmed by love
I soon shall view the promised land
Pain and toil are over now
Pain can cause thoughts that never relax
Our spirits have been redeemed from sin, now white as snow
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem
The street stands crowded from wall to wall
When they heard that Jesus was coming
Palms of glory, raiment bright
Panis angelicus, fit panis hominum (Holy and living bread, wondrous food from heaven sent)
A little childish voice is stilled
Para para, pitter pat
A sower went out to sow the seed
How sweet the word of Christ the Lord
In visions I see a beautiful garden
Hark! from the regions of darkest night
Art thou afraid his power shall fail
O God my heart prepared is
My crimes awake, and hideous fear
Pardon me, O my God
Forgive our sins, Lord
Marching along with Jesus the Savior to glory
If you could see me now, Parents Gone, Parents Gone
Parinirvana the Lord now is entering
Part in peace, Christ's life was peace
Part in peace; is day before us?
'Twas all part of the plan
Part the waters that surround me
A solemn march we make
Why stay we here, so loth to part?
And now before we part, we'll say to all, goodnight
Now Lord, though we must part awhile
[Partners in the Gospel]
In the lives of all who suffer
Partners of a glorious hope
We are partners with the Son of God
Paschal Feast! Upon the cross
If you would help your fellow men
It only takes a spark
When bow'd with afflictions and woes here below
There is no greater love than this
Past performance is no guarantee
Past the cross with all its shame
A welcome to our pastor dear
Lord, now your servant may go in peace
Patience, O what a grace divine
See the farmer await the yield of the soil
My soul for Thy salvation faints
Patient prayer has power with God
When I've preached God's word with the Spirit's pow'r
Brother today the way is bright
Damascus bound, Saul meant to prey
[Paul:  Take heart, my Friends]
When Paul was parted from his friends

The Fathers' love I came to give
Peace of mind and peace of soul
Peace among earth's peoples is like a star
There is perfect peace and joy in the Lord's employ
Storm tossed soul on life's rough, heaving ocean
Once upon the heaving ocean
Peace be to this congregation
Peace be unto you from the watching angels
Peace be with you, peace forever
Peace be yours till we meet again
Peace came to earth at last that chosen night
Peace comes crying through the world
Peace for our times, O Lord, we pray
Peace for the children, peace, peace
Life is full of ups and downs
Peace has unveiled her smiling face
Peace I give to you
[Peace I Leave With You]
Peace I leave with you
Rest, rest thee, weary heart
There's peace in my heart today
Peace in our time, O Lord,
There's a peace in serving Jesus
I am tired and weary, but I must toil on
Peace is flowing like a river
Peace is mine, I've naught to fear
Peace is not what I looked for
A sweet new song is in my soul
Peace, like a river, flowing so free
[Peace-Making Man]
To share God's love is why I came
[Peace, My Own Peace, Is the Gift I Leave with You]
Peace of our praying
The Savior came to earth one day
Oh, list and hear throâ€™ circling years
Peace, peace; God's wonderful peace
Peace, peace, sweet peace
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin
Lead me from death to life, from falsehood to truth
Lord, make me a means of your peace
There is peace in the fast fading twilight
[Peace Song]
Peace, that passeth understanding
Peace, 'tis the Lord Jehovah's hand
Peace to soothe our bitter woes
Peace to you
Peace, peace be unto you
Therefore being justified by faith
Peace with the Father, peace with Christ his Son
When I sought the Lord I found
Peacefully lay her [him] down to rest
While your face is toward that city
I know, I know my Savior died
From out the depths I cry to Thee
You were sent to heal the contrite
Have mercy on us, O Lord
Lord Jesus, you raise us to new life
With conscious guilt and bleeding heart
[Pentecost]
Go in the joy of the rushing wind
You've poured out Your Spirit, Great Father of Life
Come, Holy Spirit, come!
Throughout the world today is sounding
Deep were the groans that heaved my breast
People are more than the worst they've done
People, gather round! Shout!
People in darkness are looking for light
People, look east. The time is near
People need the Lord
People of faith, standing together
With our lips let us sing one confession
New beginnings, here in our midst
Where we encounter hatred, let us bring your love
People of the living God
We are your people of the night
How do you share the love of Jesus with a lonely man?
People we need to meet
People will change when put in diff'rent situations
[People Worry]
Peoples, clap your hands! Shout to God with joy
Give us perfect hearts dear Saviour
There's a love most true shown by Christ for you
There is perfect peace in my soul
He whose mind is stayed on thee
In perfect peace, O gracious Lord
Oh Lord, how excellent, how excellent
We sing of a glorious morrow
I am happy today, with a joy from above
Perhaps the songs that once you sang
Perhaps you have been chosen
Now Christ again to me appears
The sinner that by precious faith
The off'ring on the altar burned
Peter and James and John in a sailboat
I wonder where my mother is gone
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter
Fervent persevering prayers

In the garden boldly

Pity a helpless sinner, Lord
Let us plant a garden for our Lord today
Plant the cross in my heart dear Saviour, humbly to Thee I come
Planted wheat, within the wheatfields
Planter of gardens, Sender of rain
Pleading for admission with the Savior
Sin has undone our wretched race
Almost persuaded, the Spirit now pleads
Pleasant are thy courts above
Please enter my heart, hosanna
Guide my feet, Lord
Never, never, with God's help
Plenteous He is in truth and grace
My Lord's done just what he said
I would not be a sinner
There's plenty of food at the table
By grace, thro' faith, plus nothing

Tremble, O earth, Tremble, O earth  
When Israel came forth from Egypt
When Isr'el out of Egypt went
Not to our names, thou only just and true

Happy are they whose way is blameless
Father, I bless thy gentle hand
My part, I have resolved, O Lord
I have said, O Lord, that my part
Blessed are they that undefil'd
Behold thy waiting servant, Lord
Thou mad'st and fashion'dst me: thy laws
O that the Lord would guide my ways
My soul for thy salvation faints
My God, consider my distress
Thy word for ever is, O Lord
With my whole heart I've sought thy face:
O how love I thy law! it is
Consider all my sorrows, Lord
Thy word is to my feet a lamp
O that thy statutes every hour
I hate the thoughts of vanity
My soul lies cleaving to the dust
To all men I have judgment done
When pain and anguish seize me, Lord
Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful
O Lord, thou art most righteous
With my whole heart I cry'd, Lord, hear
To thee, before the dawning light
By what means shall a young man learn
Consider mine affliction
Princes have persecuted me
O let my earnest pray'r and cry
Thou art my portion, O my God
With me thy servant, in thy grace
How shall the young secure their hearts
My soul to dust cleaves: quicken me
O how I love thy holy law!
Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
Lord, I esteem thy judgments right
Let thy sweet mercies also come
Let all the heathen writers join
Remember, Lord, thy gracious word
Lord, I have made thy word my choice
Thou my sure portion art alone
Thy mercies fill the earth, O Lord
Well hast thou with thy servant dealt
Thou art my portion, O Lord
Thou has dealt well with thy servant
My soul fainteth for thy salvation
O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day
I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord
Consider mine affliction, and deliver me
Lord, if thou dost not soon appear
Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail
You, O Lord, you, O Lord
I trust in your merciful love
Help, Lord, because the godly man
Thou God of love, thou ever-blest
In my trouble I called to the Lord
In my distress to God I cry'd
Upward I lift mine eyes
To heav'n I lift my waiting eyes
Up to the hills I lift mine eyes
Be strong in the Lord
In the shadow of your wings I sing for joy
The righteous live forever
I lift my eyes to the mountains
My help comes from God
We shall go up with joy
My help comes only from the Lord
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
I to the hills will lift mine eyes
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
Our help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
I lift up my eyes to the mountains
How pleased and blest was I
How did my heart rejoice to hear
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem
God has made me glad
We lift our eyes to the Lord
I was glad when they said to me
Give peace, O Lord, to those who wait for you
I joy'd when to the house of God
Jerusalem, God's city
I rejoiced when I heard them say: "Let us go to the house of the Lord"
Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord
I rejoiced when they said to me
How I rejoiced to hear them say
O thou whose grace and justice reign
Our eyes rest on you, Lord
O thou that dwellest in the heav'ns
Had not the Lord, may Isr'el say
Our help is in the name of the Lord
Had not the Lord been on our side
Now Israel
Firm and unmoved are they
Unshaken as the sacred hill
Those who trust in the Lord 
Shalom, shalom, the peace of God be here
They in the Lord that firmly trust
When God revealed his gracious name
When God restored our captive state
The Lord has done great things for us
When Zion's fortunes God restored, It was a dream come true
When the LORD brought back the exiles of Sion
May the Lord watch over this house
Our mouth was filled with laughter
Those who sow in tears and sorrow
When the Lord delivered Zion from bondage
When the Lord delivered Zion, We were like people dreaming
When God set the captives of Zion free
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion
When God first brought us back from exile
When Sion's bondage God turn'd back
If God succeed not, all the cost
If God to build the house deny
Children are a heritage from the Lord
If the LORD does not build the house
Unless the Lord builds the house
Except the Lord do build the house
O happy man, whose soul is filled
Blest are those who love you
Bless'd is each one that fears the Lord
Blessed are all who fear the LORD, and walk in his ways!
Happy all those who fear the Lord 
Up from my youth, may Isr'el say
The blessing of the Lord be upon you
Oft did they vex me from my youth
How long, O Lord, shall I complain
How long wilt thou conceal thy face?
My heart will rejoice in your salvation, O Lord
How long wilt thou forget me, Lord?
From deep distress and troubled thoughts
Out of the deeps of long distress
In my distress I cry to the Lord
From the depths I cry to you
Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord, hear my plea
In deep despair I cry to you
Lord, from the depths to thee I cry'd
From out of the depths
Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord
From out of the depths, I cry unto you

While men grow bold in wicked ways
When man grows bold in sin
I desire to follow your way
How precious is your unfailing love, O God
The wicked man's transgression
The humble shall own the land
For evil-doers fret thou not
Why should I vex my soul, and fret
Why do the wealthy wicked boast
My God, the steps of pious men
Amidst thy wrath remember love
Do not forsake me, O Lord
Now, O Lord, for what do I wait
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry
I said, I will look to my ways
Thus I resolved before the Lord
God of my life, look gently down
Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray
O God of grace and righteousness
In the night I can take my rest
Give ear unto me when I call
Listen to my song, Hear me when I call
The wonders, Lord, thy love has wrought
Wait for the Lord, whose day is near

Blessed is he that wisely doth
Happy those who consider the poor and the weak
My soul is thirsting for the Lord
God will give you a new heart
As the deer longs for the waterbrook
I will go to the altar of God
My soul is thirsting for God
Athirst is my soul for God
As the deer longs for running waters
As a deer seeks flowing waters
Like as the hart for water-brooks
With earnest longings of the mind
My spirit sinks within me, Lord
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
Lord, we have heard thy works of old
Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love
Rise up, come to our help
O God, we with our ears have heard
My Savior and my King
I'll speak the honors of my King
The peoples shall praise you for ever
My heart brings forth a goodly thing

Ride on, ride on, in majesty
Ride on, ride on, O Savior-King
Riding along, singing a song
Since Jesus has placed in my heart a new song
We're a band of happy pilgrims riding over the ocean wide
Riding the love waves to glory with my wonderful King
We are riding on the wheels of time, yes riding day by day
Out on the ocean, facing the gale
With my Lord I'm daily riding, on the glory line
I am riding home to Heaven on the glory waves
I am on the sea of time, on the gospel ship sublime
Riding out across the desert
Right Thought will lead me on

You gave us, Lord, by word and deed
Fountain of mercy, grace flowing free
I'll sing of a river divine,
River running in you and me
River, wash over me
Rivers of love freely flowing from Mt. Calvary
Rock-a-bye, my dear little boy
Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight, Make me a child again just for tonight
When you see my coffin come

Rod of the Root of Jesse
They have been saying
Forward, said the prophet, pointing to the sea
Over life's billows flying
O brother, you ought to have been there
When I was blind and could not see King Jesus brought that light to me
Roll on, roll on
Do you know a righteous cause
Rolled away, rolled away, rolled away
O my heart is full of gladness since by faith I saw the Lord
Every sin had to go
[Romans 16:19]
Ungrateful sinners! whence this scorn
Vain are the hopes the sons of men
And shall we then go on to sin
And we know, and we know
Let Christian faith and hope dispel
[Romans Doxology]
I am not under law, I'm under grace
[Roni Roni Bat Zion]
Room, room. room at the cross
There was room at the cross for a sinner like me
Have you any room for Jesus?
There is room in the kingdom of God
Yes, there is room for Jesus
When the dewy light was fading
[Rooted and Grounded in One Loving Source]
I'm rooted in eternal love
Rorate coeli desuper!
Many years ago while wand'ring
Bloom in my heart today
Sweet Rose of Sharon in Thee I see
Rosetime, we love thee, bright Summer days
I would not have it all roses
Rosy dawn, with locks of gold
Round me falls the night
There's a place that's dear to me, ever sacred as can be
Round the Lord in glory seated
Rouse thyself, my soul, and gather
Do all the good you can
Rumours of angels, visions of light
O soul adrift and in despair
There's a race for all to run
Running over, Running over
Since the Lord has come to dwell
Long ago to Bethlehem, From afar returning

Again 'tis holy Sabbath day
O Lord, wherewith have we deserved
You fed your people on their journey to the land of promise
All praise be yours through Brother Sun
Once, on a day, was Christ led forth to die
Sacred Heart of Jesus, meek and mild
By the power of your presence here
I can hear the Savior calling
God my Father, Christ my brother
In the twilight's sacred stillness
Sacred the body God has created
Sacred are the tho'ts of the blessed Saviour
Drifting, drifting, sadly drifting
Oft they (now Israel may say)
My soul was tossed by angry waves
Safe from ev'ry storm that blows
Some golden day when life is done
Safe in His arms, I rest my soul
No matter how heavy the load
Safe in the centre of Thy loving Will
O Jesus, my Rock
Wonderful story of mercy and love
Blest revelation, wondrous salvation
I am safe in the Savior's keeping
Safe in the shadow of the Lord
Though beneath the drifting snow
Long have I wandered from Thee, my Saviour
The billows of Jordan are swelling
Hasten, Shepherd, to the mountain
Safe upon the billowy deep
While we're sleeping
O let all that trust thy care
Safely, safely gathered in
Said Judas to Mary, "Now What Will You Do"
Upon a wide and stormy sea
In this life we're on a journey down the lonesome road
I sailed today down mem'ry's bright way
O'er life's wild sea
I was sailing o'er life's sea, and there seemed no help for me
We are sailing o'er life's ocean
Sailing o'er life's stormy sea
Happy in the love that saved my soul I'm sailing along
We're a happy pilgrim band
We're a band of happy singers on the way to heaven
We weigh the anchor, spread the sail
So often here the tempest rages and the mighty billows roll
I can sail the roughest sea
For many a day I have traveled
Chaste guardian of the Virgin
Saint Joseph, Mary's faithful spouse
Saints and angels sing his praise
Saints of God, come to his/her aid!
I saw the souls of the saints beneath the altar
Saints of God! the dawn is brightening
Your peace within us, Lord, will stand
We stand up straight when we salute

O ye who are bound by the fetters of sin
Salvation Lord is thine
Salvation now to us has come
Salvation, O sing the glad story
I heard the word salvation

Down at the cross on Calvary's mountain
Out in the low lands of sin life I wandered away
Salvation's work is done
Salve, Regina (Hail, blessed Lady)

In the midst of foes I cry to thee
Write to Sardis, (said the Lord)
Brother as you journey down the road of life
'Tis false, thou vile accuser, go
Satan, the dire invader, came
Satan, we're gonna tear your kingdom down
All my life long I had panted
Some day, when all my heartaches cease
When I have finished my pilgrimage here
The loving Saviour found me
I'll trust the dear Father who knows what is best
Once I was lost in sin, having no peace within
I am satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Him
He gives me satisfying peace
It matters not what be thy lot

I have found redemption in the Savior's blood
I'm happy in Jesus as onward I go
I once was a sinner away from the fold
Why should I worry when foes assail, I am saved
Saved to serve him, Christ my Saviour
On the Rock I stand, viewing heaven's land
"Saved tonight, O blessed Jesus!"
We're Saved, Saved to tell others of the Man of Galilee
Saved to the uttermost: I am the Lord's
All glorious God, what hymns of praise Shall our transported voice raise!

In a world where sorrow
You will help to bear the burden of some one wherever you go

Scatter sweet flowers, fragrant and fair
Scatter the darkness, break the gloom
Scatter the last remains of sin

Shall I not sing praise to Thee
Shall men pretend to pleasure
Shall tribulation or distress
Shall we gather at the river

Sight, hearing, felling, taste and smell
When Jesus comes, oh, the trumpet will sound loud
Surely, you alone can save us

Signs and wonders lead the dancing
Signs of endings all around us
Silence, frenzied, unclean spirit
Silence my heart, blessed Lord
Silent and still I stand
Still the night, holy the night
Silent night! hallowed night
Silent night! Holy night!
Silent night, holy night, all is held in slumber's might
Silent voices, unheard voices
Silently now I wait for thee
Silently o'er Bethlehem
Out of the shadowland, into the sunshine
Peter and John went to pray
Darling, I am growing old
When the Lord shall call for His children, all
O Jesus scourged, derided, mocked
Simple innocence, most holy
Simply by trusting in Jesus
Their God and Saviour they forgot
What wretched fools are they, who hear
Sin enslaved me many years
Sin is the fatal cause of woe
"Sin shall have no dominion over you"
The pains that wait our fleeting breath
Since all the varying scenes of time
Since Christ has gone to heav'n His home
Since Christ our Passover is slain
My life was full of sorrow
Since God is all my trust
Since godly men decay, O Lord
I am living under grace
Life has been so sweet to me
Since I gave my heart to Jesus
The sweetest, grandest feeling
How can I in sadness pine when I have Jesus
Since I have learned the story
Since I made the Savior mine
Since in the Lord my hope secure is placed
Since I've known a Savior's name
As I go on my way, I'm happy ev'ry day
My life was once so very drear
In sin I once was straying, no thought of ever praying
[Since Jesus Gave His Life for Us]
Gone is the load of sin that bound me, I am glad and free
I've been happy ev'ry day, walking in the gospel way
Since I believed the story
I sigh not for riches, I seek not for fame
I'm joyfully singing as onward I go
Since Jesus is my Friend
Since Jesus made His home in my heart
Lord I wandered in sin far away from the fold
One time the billows fierce did roll
Since life in sorrow must be spent
Since man by sin has lost his God
I've been made acquainted with Jesus the King
Since my Saviour came from heav'n to save me
Since now the day hath reached its close
Since others do so much for me
Since our great high priest, Christ Jesus
There are those that we love, and walked with down here
All my sorrows have departed, I'm no longer heavy hearted
Since the Comforter has come, every door is opened wide
Since the day the angel came
I am free as a bird on the wing
I am on my way to the land of day
Wonderful songs of love are ringing in my soul
Since the Son hath made me free
[Since, Then, We Have a Great High Priest]
[Since Then You Have Been Raised]
Since thou, the everlasting God
Since through God's mercy this ministry's ours
Since thy Father's arm sustains thee
Since we have confidence to come to God

Sinful, sighing to be blest

O singers of the mystic clime
Singers, sing, and trumpets play
Singing, singing, I go singing
Now with joy my heart is tuned
As here we journey thru the lowlands of sin
Since my heart was given to the King of heaven
Mid innocence and joyous glee
All my sins have been forgiven, and I'm happy all the time
Let's keep our joybells ever ringing
We'll watch and pray and labor every day
If singing God's praises brings joy to the soul
Upon the King's highway
Singing for Jesus, singing for Jesus
Singing for Jesus, and trying to win
Going to glory, daily singing the story
Singing for Jesus, our Savior and King
Happy voices let us raise
Who will join our "Junior Band"?
One of these days, it won't be long
When I leave this world of sin and sorrow, and I reach the glory land
When we reach the City over on the golden shore
Hark! I hear the songs of angels
Since I trusted my dear Saviour
A garden sweet, awaits me yonder
When the saints of God are gathering over on the shore
O precious Saviour, how we do love Thee
Singing, singing, light and free
Songs of rejoicing to Jesus we're voicing
I'm traveling homeward with Jesus, on the glory road
Singing of His love
Whenever ills oppress me
I was sitting by my window one dark winter day
Singing singing Happy along the way
On the good old road that my fathers trod
I am singing out the praises
Jesus is the theme we sing
Since the Saviour came, bless His holy name
Songs, happy songs we would ender to Thee
Singing songs of expectation
Singing songs of sadness
Sing a song for Jesus
Singing the Lord's song
Singing we go, our joy to show
Sink not yet, my soul, to slumber
Sinner, art thou still secure?
Behold the dear Lord on the cross
Sinner, won't you come to Jesus
Sinner, heed the voice of mercy
Sinner, Jesus loves you still
Our Savior once left his bright home above
I know that my Redeemer lives
Sinner secure, the writing see!
Sinner, what has earth to show
Sinners, attend the dreadful word
Sinners, come, the Savior see
Sinners, dismiss your fear
Sinners may to Christ draw near
Sinners, obey the gracious call
Sinners, turn: why will you die
Sion, haste to meet thy king
Rise and shine forth, for your light has come
Sion's daughters! Sons of Jerusalem!
Creator, Father, Prince of might!
Dear sister's gone to be with Jesus
Oh, three wise men to Jerusalem came
Sisters and brothers, with one voice
Sisters let us walk together
Know you mighty tired
Sitting at His feet, sitting at His feet
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Sitting by the wayside, sinful, weak and blind
Skating, skating all around
Skillful hands and nimble fingers
Skipping down the pavement wide
Skipping is fun, skipping is fun
Now our busy day is o'er
Sleep at last has fled these eyes
Sleep, baby, sleep!
Sleep, holy Babe, Upon Thy Mother's breast
Sleep, little Baby, sleep, O sleep
Sleep, weary world, and take thy rest
Sleep well, my dear, sleep safe and free
Sleepers awake! the night's long reign is past
"Sleepers, wake!" A voice astounds us
Sleeping 'neath the wilted flowers
As you onward go along earth's road
O smile and be cheerful, though life may seem long
Walking with Jesus on the homeward way
O what a story now I am telling
All is not sunshine in this world of ours
Smiling thru tears, down thru the years
Smite us not in anger, Lord
O the snowflakes, dancing snowflakes
Gabriel's message does away
So brightly burns Love's holy glow
So dear to me, beloved homeland
So fades the lovely, blooming flow'r
So far from home, O God, how will it be?
So fly our months and years
So foolish, so absurd am I
So freely
So glad I'm here, so glad I'm here, Lord
So glad I'm here in Jesus' name
So God loved the people of the world
Autumn days when the grass is jewelled
Just as a mother sings her baby to sleep
We are going some day to a land far away
I have fondest recollection of the days that used to be
So, Lord, Thou goest forth to die
So many centuries of watching and waiting
So many many years ago
So many ways to live our lives
So often I think of heaven my home
So precious is Jesus, my blessed redeemer, my Lord and King
So rest, my Rest
So send I you - by grace made strong to triumph
So send I you to labor unrewarded,
So the day dawn for me
"So truly as I live," God saith
God of creation
His love to me is so wonderful
We're a happy band of Christian workers
I have a wonderful Friend indeed
When Jesus had gathered with those he loved
Soft rains of spring flow through the fields
Soften my heart
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Softly now the day is ending
Softly sing the sweet word "Jesus"
Softly the night is sleeping
Soil of God, you and I, stand ready to bear
Soldiers brave march along
Somewhere away back in the mountains
We're a band of soldiers in the army of our blessed Lord and Saviour
Soldiers, go, but not to claim
Soldiers in the Army Of the Lord our King (McPhail)
Soldiers of Christ, arise
Soldiers of Jesus! soldiers of the Cross!
We are soldiers pressing on to glory ever
Soldiers of the cross, arise
We are soldiers of the King, As we march we sweetly sing
Soldiers of Christ the King, keep marching on and upward
We are soldiers of the Lord
Soldiers who to Christ belong
Solemnly we now confess
O God of blessings, all praise to you!
My name is Solomon Levi
I Sharon's rose, and lilly am
Some are young, some old
Be not aweary, for labor will cease
Here our load is often heavy, dangers meet on ev'ry hand
Some children see Him lily white
Some day, a gladsome message
Some day Christ will call us homeward
Some day I do not know just now
Some day we'll meet up in glory
Love is leading me each day
Some day we'll cease from labor here
Some day when all of life's sadness is over
I do not know why oft 'round me
Some day, I know, the mist that life is veiling
How oft do I grieve o'er my sins and my weakness
So many sing of home, sweet home, of days that used to be
O HOW I'd like to see his face
Some happy day I'm going yonder, to my eternal home
Some day I'm going over Jordan to stay
Some day, I know not when 'twill be
I have heard of a beautiful city, A city where cometh no night
There's a day that's coming soon, when we all must stand the test
Myst'ries of life that now seem dark
Some time 'tis hard to understand
Does it seem so unjust and so cruel today?
Wanted a day after it's thro'
Some glad day when ends life's way
We shall reach that city bright
Some glad day when trials here are over
Some glad day, when the Lord shall call me
Some glad sweet day, the Master's voice will call me
The riches of earth are like a dream
We shall wear a crown of shining gold, when the pearly gates for us unfold
Some glorious morning sorrow will cease
Some day the sun of life shall set
As day by day I travel onward singing
As on I go with Christ my Lord
Sometime the clouds will disappear
Some delightful morning we shall have a better life
Some morning bright, our Lord we'll see
O wonderful love of Jesus
On some glad morning yonder in glory land
I'm goin' t' sit down at the welcome table
Some of these days all the skies will be brighter
Someone is called by the Master  to go
Some one is coming some morning
Up in that beautiful world above
Someone will live his life in sin
Some seed fell in rich soil 
Some sunny day I'm going home
Some sunrise morning when our toiling is o'er
Some sweet day, by His grace
Some day every shadow will be gone
Some sweet day when life is o'er
Some walk in honour's gaudy shew
There's a mansion in Heaven that fair City on high
Somebody did a golden deed, Proving himself a friend in need
O my Lord, O my Lord, I listened, listened
Somebody cares for me, somebody knows
Never alone in this earthly way
How are you spending your earthly days?
Somebody knows the conflicts
There is somebody near you now struggling alone
Somebody prayed for me, had me on their mind
Knocks like Jesus
Someday when guns are gone
Someone asked the question, "Why do we sing?
Do you sometimes feel that no one truly knows you
[Someone Is Looking to You]
Someone is waiting right outside your door
O ye who are fearful whate'er may befall
Someone shall go at the Master's word
Someone should clean up this mess!
Something beautiful, something good
If your heart belongs to Jesus who has died for sin
Something every heart is loving
There is something for children to do
Right there in the dust
Something happened when He saved me
When the clouds hang low on the path as you go
I have something Jesus gave me for my own
Oh, yes, I know there's something more
Something which is known
Preachers and teachers would make their appeal
Life was shattered and hope was gone
Something's coming down the street
Sometime I'll see my Savior
Sometime the hands, grown weary with lifeâ€™s toiling
Sometime our tears will all be wiped away
"Sometime," you say, when the Master is pleading
We know not what awaits us there
Sometime, somewhere, yes, some sweet day
Sometime, somewhere, beyond earth's fleeting
Sometimes a light surprises
O let us lift our voices
Sometimes Alleluia
Sometimes I feel like a moanin' dove
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I wake before the dawn
Sometimes the roses bloom and ev'ry thing is gay
Sometimes when I'm praying 
Sometimes when morning lights the sky
Somewhere beyond the blue there's a mansion for me
Sometimes the storms are beating
Somewhere in heaven a home is given
Somewhere beyond this vale of tears and sorrow
Son of God! all glorious Savior
[Son of God, by God Forsaken]

In the east, the place of dawning
I will sing to the Lord, in glory triumphant
Just forget you're sad, in your heart keep glad
I want to go out
Now we sing to praise love's blessing
May we be a shining light to the nations
The Lord will vindicate His people
Thou must not altogether be
May Christ who died for you lead you into his kingdom
The Lord is my light and my help
May the angels carry you to paradise
I know my Savior lives! His voice will bid me rise again!
From the four winds, and the high seas
My soul is filled with joy in God my Savior
My heart exults in the LORD
[Song of Jabez]
In the fish for three days buried
Young Joseph's father liked him best
Not in darkness nor in mystery
My spirit glorifies the Lord
My soul gives glory to my God
My soul doth magnify the Lord, My spirit doth rejoice in God (Shafer)
Let us sing the praises of Mary
Blessed are you among women
My soul proclaims with wonder

After clouds we see the sun
May songs of the angels welcome you
Rejoice, you saints, in God
I remember, and my soul melts within me
God, our loving Father, I'm glad as I can be
The Spirit of the Lord has brought new life to earth
Hark, the lilies whisper
What I am doing now you do not know

Happy children of the heavenly king
Praised be the God of Israel
Blest be the God of Israel
Blest be the God of Israel
Blest be God, the Lord of Israel
Come fill our waiting hearts
There are songs of love divine, ringing in this soul of mine
In the night of lonely sorrow, with the soul bowed down by grief
There's a song in my heart that the world cannot sing
Let us go forth with light and love to sing
Songs of praise the angels sang
Songs of thankfulness and praise
From the depths I cry to you, O Lord
Songs of Wesak hear us singing
Hark! I hear a soft refrain, Echoing to and fro
Sons of light, join heirs with Jesus
Sons of the Holy One bright with his splendour
To You, O Lord, we lift our voice
No more weeping and awailing
Soon and very soon we are goin' to see the King
Fast the evening shades are falling
Soon I'm moving to a country where my Savior has gone
Soon may the last glad song arise
Soon shall this earthly frame, dissolved
Brother, if your path seems dreary
Soon will the heavenly Bridegroom come
Yonder's the land where the loved ones are
Soul, adorn yourself with gladness
Soul, couldst thou while on earth remaining
Water from the side of Christ, wash me
Soul of my Savior, sanctify my breast
Soul, redeemed by Love Divine
Soul, strength, and courage
Soul, what return has thy Creator
Souls in heathen darkness lying
Souls of men, why will ye scatter
Sound a mystic bamboo song
Sound aloud Jehovah's praises
Sound the alarm the Lord is near!
Sound the battle cry!
Sound the mighty Champion's praises
[Sound the Trumpet, All You People]
Sound ye the trumpet call; heralds proclaim

Spring has come, I know, I know
Spring forth a well (I've got a river of light)
Winter's stormy days are over now
Spring up, O well, sweet fountain, spring
Springing up, within my heart
Springs and streams no longer bless
How oft the happy mountain top we leave behind
Buried with Christ in death
I saw water rushing forth
I saw water flowing from the right side of the temple
Sprinkled with reconciling blood 
God is in our midst
Spurn me not, O loving Savior
Uprouse ye, Christian people
Christ be behind me
O kunde jeg opstige
Jesus on the cross is dying
O blest Redeemer, to us each recall
Stand alone for Jesus till the shadows fall
Stand by for heaven's radio
When the storms of life are raging
Stand fast for God, though all alone
Stand fast, my soul, stand fast
Stand, O stand firm
Let us rally round the standard
Be firm in your stand for the truth and the right
[Stand Firm in Faith]
Stand firm, my soul when storms of doubt are raging
See the captive Daniel kneeling at his prayer
O soldiers of Christ, unto thee is the call
Stand for the right and stand for the true
To the field of the world and its conflict today
Stand in awe of the one who hears the cry of the poor
Stand like an anvil, when the stroke
On God's Word my house will stand tall
Be thou watchful, O my soul
Stand on Thy Watch-tower, Habakkuk the Seer
Stand, soldier of the cross
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord
Stand together in the cause we love

Stand up, O God, be present now

Standing at bat as the teams look at me
Standing at the future's threshold
Not my brother, nor my sister, but it's me, O Lord
The Savior now is standing Outside the fast closed door
Tell me, whose side are you standing on?
Standing on the promises of Christ my King
I have found a wondrous secret in the dear old Book Divine
Safely I'm standing on the Rock that is sure
Judgment is surely coming, Coming to you and me
[Star in the East]
Star of Bethlehem, shining bright
There's a star of hope that shines its light
When my strength seemeth almost gone
Rest of the weary, and hope of the soul
Star of peace to wanderers weary
Star of the east, how sweet art Thou
[Star of the Morning]
Star of ocean fairest
Star, that rose on Bethl'hem Judah
Star upon the ocean, Maria
We are marching on to the land of love
Stars and planets flung in orbit
Stars of glory, shine more brightly
There are stars of promise
Stars of the Morning
Stars on stars of heaven's floor
Brother, let me tell you what to do in trouble
Startle us, God, by the signs of Your Spirit around us!

[Stations of the Cross]
Kneeling in the garden grass
Ten virgins all were called to greet the bridegroom fair
Stay awake, be ready
Stay here and keep watch with me
My heart is nearly broken with sorrow
Stay here where nails are driven
Stay with me, remain here with me
Stay with us, till night has come
[Stay With Us]
Jesus Christ, Lord of all
Stay with us, Savior, for ev'ning is coming
Mighty army of the Lord
Steady, brother, steady, tho' the strom-winds rise
I hear God calling
Lonesome road
O, steal away and pray
When your burdens seem too heavy
My Lord he calls me
Steal away to Jesus, to the secret place of prayer
Steeple bells are ringing
See God's mercy brightly beaming
Hearken O man across the border
O God, you are my God
Step by step, every day
Step by step I'll follow Jesus
Step by step we march along
Step by step we climb the hills of glory
I am nearing that city just over the way
Step by step, our Father leads us upward
He's the one to follow
Step by step with Jesus, He will lead the way
We're keepers of the door
The waters are troubled, the pool is night
The old Ship of Zion glides up to the shore
To subdue earth's sin and the vict'ry win
Step into the sunshine, Get out of the shade
Step on, O Christian, till you reach the glory land
Step out on the promise of Jesus today
Stephen, first of Christian martyrs
Stepping on together in the ranks of truth
Jesus Christ was made, we're told, the Chief Corner stone
All praise to you, O Lord of all creation
Stewards, we seek to do God's will
I want to keep my record book
Speak unto the children of Israel
O Paradise above!
Thee, as the evening light declines
A Great and Mighty Wonder
Who would not weep my child
When the trumpet's sound shall wake
Surely comes the dreadful day
Now the Lord from earth ascending
Wherefore on the Cross uplifted
Thy glorious rising on the first of days
Ah! woe is me because of sin
Come friends behold me here
Firm through the endless years
The day of resurrection!
Hide me now under Your wings
Still closer to Jesus! still closer, we pray
Still for thy loving kindness, Lord
Sometimes the way of life is steep
Some one has slighted the Savior today
Still, I search for my God
"Nearer, my God, to Thee"
Still on the homeward journey
Still one in life and one in death
Still out of the deepest abyss
Still, still, still
Still, still, still, This night is calm and still
Still, still, still, for Jesus goes to sleep
Still, still with thee, when purple morning breaketh
Still, still, without ceasing
To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn
Soul, bending low in thy sorrow and care
Still throned in heaven, to men in unbelief
Still watching and waiting
Still will we trust, though earth seem dark and dreary
Stillness reignsâ€”the vapors steal
Stir me, O Lord, that I may give
Stir me, O Lord, as Thou wast stirred
Stir my heart, O Lord
Stir your church, O God, our Father
Stone on stone weâ€™re building, working day by day
[Stone So Heavy, Who Will Move It]
Stood the Lord, His heart full grieving
Stop! And let me tell you what the Lord has done for me
O careless soul, on life's broad way
I need thee, oh, I need thee
As you travel along, see yourself going wrong
Stop! Stop! á¸¤anukkah top!
Storms will come and storms will go
Stormy waters all around me, waves are rough and rolling high
I love to hear the story old
Coming down thru years of changes
Never from the path of duty
God tells us in his word
Strangers, whence came ye to the West
Streams of living water shall flow from within you
In the common round of duty
There is a road meant for you to travel
Strength of the still secluded thought
Strengthen all the weary hands
Strengthen for service, Lord, the hands 
In the fierce, tempestuous hour
Stretch forth thy hand, thy wither'd hand
Strew palms, strew palms upon the way
Stricken, smitten, and afflicted
Strict silence keep not, sov'reign Lord--behold
Strike your harps of gold
Fellow pilgrim sing a glad song as with Christ you travel along
O brother, strive! thy crown is not yet won
Strive when thou art called of God
Striving onward, pressing forward
Striving to be someone who's rich
When we're weary, sad, and lonely
Strong arm of God, make known thy power
Strong, Gentle Children
[Strong in Christ, Our Great Salvation]
Dawn of the morning and stars of the night
Strong is the hand that is leading me daily along the way
Strong, righteous Man of Galilee,
There is Love
[Stronghold]
Study to show thyself approved unto God
Stupendous grace! and can it be
Stupendous mystery
Sublimer thoughts inspire my breast
If you submit to the will of God and let Him use you in His
The agony, the sweat of blood
Such as I have, Lord, give unto thee
When we were drifting in sin and despair
That God should love a sinner such as I
Such love, pure as the whitest snow
There's a wonderful love in Jesus my Lord
Perfect joy in my heart is abounding
[Suddenly]
[Suddenly God's Sovereign Wind]
Come unto me, still through the ages falling
Suffer the children to come unto Me, Suffer the children to come unto Me
Hark, I hear my Savior say Suffer the children to come to me
Save me, O God, because the floods
Suffering Savior on the tree
Suffering Son of Man, be near me
My grace, my grace for thee, my child
Go forth, my heart, and seek delight
Summer suns are glowing
Summoned my labour to renew
Sun, moon and stars, by day and night
Sun of my soul, thou Savior dear
Sun of righteousness, shine forth
Sun of righteousness, arise
Sun of Righteousness, arise!
Sun, shine forth in all thy splendor
Sun! stay thy course, this moment stay
We are little sunbeams, Shining day by day
Our Lord is risen indeed, And bids his members rife
Sunday's Palms are Wednesday's ashes
Sunk in the depths of woe, to thee I cried
Sunk is the sun's last beam of light
O the brightness and the glory of love that came to me
Sunlight of love is flooding my soul
Sunlight of the heavenly day
When I shall come to the end of my way
Once the path I trod was dark as night
O Lord, O Lord
Slow the sun now sinks from sight
Our life passes on like a swift flowing stream
Sunset and evening star
Pilgrims for Jesus in a lowland of sin
Sunset is nearing
O bright golden sunset
Sunset to sunrise changes now
There is sunshine all the way with Jesus
There is sunshine and glory in the wonderful story
When I walked with my Lord in the sunshine
Sunshine and shadows both are met on our way
No matter how dark and dreary the day
This world is filled with both sunshine and rain
In this world, where shadows 
In spite of gloom and darkness
Sunshine, sunshine in my soul to-day
God is our light and God is our sunshine
On the golden sunshine trail
When as we sat in Babylon
O Lord, my God, for Thy Name's sake
Our human needs by God are met
Though terrors late alarm'd my breast
Supreme in mercy, who shall dare
Supreme in wisdom as in power
Supreme of beings, with delight
Sure as I live, thy Maker saith
Sure God is good to Israel. Even to the clean in heart
Sure the blest Comforter is nigh
Sure wicked fools, devoid of shame
Sure, wicked fools must needs suppose
As pilgrims all
Surely God is good to Israel
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
The realm of God: Like a woman kneading dough
Surely it is God who saves me
Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing
Surely no one can be safer
Surely the Lord is in this place
Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place
Surpassing great the gift of God
Surprised by joy no song can tell
I'm giving You my heart and all that is within
All I have I yield to Jesus
When the foe is pressing near
[Surrendering to God]
Surrounded by so great a cloud 
Surrounded by unnumbered foes
Swapping shoes with those we blame
Over the hilltops, down from the skies
Sweet be Thy words of sternest truth
I'm kind of homesick for a country
Sweet Child divine, of lowly grace
Sweet delight, most lovely, shining
As a christian here below, with my Saviour on I go
On mountains height, by peaceful shores
Sweet flowerets of the martyr band
Sweet flowers are blooming in Godâ€™s sight
Sweet glories rush upon my sight
There is a land beyond the sky where saints shall live some by and by
The world all around has no harbor
I'm told of a place they call Heaven
I'm only a pilgrim, traveling along
I read of a land upon a bright strand just over the sea
O why should not the children sing
Little children praise the Saviour
There is a place most dear to those
Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet is the day of sacred rest
Sweet is the light, whateâ€™er it be
Sweet is the solace of Thy love
Sweet is the solemn voice that calls
Sweet is the sunlight after rain
Sweet is Thy mercy, O my God
Sweet Jesus, when I think on thee
They tell me of a happy place
New life all divine, in Jesus is mine
When torn is the bosom by sorrow or care
There is a land beyond the sky
How precious the thought when with sorrows we meet
Sweet rivers of redeeming love
Stars gently beaming
Sweet Rose of Sharon, blooming for me
Sabbath bells are pealing soft and clear
Sweet sacrament divine
Sweet spirit, if thy airy sleep
Sweet Spirit of Christ
Sweep over my soul
Sweet tenants of this grove!
Sweet the lesson Jesus taught
Sweet the moments, rich in blessing
Sweet time of meditation
'Tis sweet to know that God hath made
When shadows are falling, sweet voices are calling
There's a peace in my heart, that each day deeper grows
Are you longing some service for others to do?
Ev'ry year is sweeter
Every day with Jesus Is sweeter than the day before
Sweetest Fount of holy gladness
Sweetest Joy the soul can know
The great Physician now is near
Sweetly now the bells are ringing
Sweetly the birds are singing
Sweetly the music is sounding
Sing, with all the saints in Glory
Swell the anthem, raise the song!
Swift as an eagleâ€™s flight
Swiftly pass the clouds of glory
Hear ye now the call my brother, to the field away
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see
Sing low sweet chariot
Swing open thy gateways, O heart of mine
Swing back for one moment, fair portals
Swing, snowy lilies, to and fro
Swinging, swinging, now we go up
Swing wide the gates
O come and sit at my table
The table which you set
Is not the bread of life we break
Take a closer look at Calvary
As you go thru this vale of sorrow, to that land of perfect day
Brother, as you travel on life's journey to that better country in the sky
Jesus will gladly make you happy, my friend
I am the word that spoke and light was made
This is the bread come down from heaven
Come before the table
O God, our great Redeemer, bow down and hear our prayer
Take care in how you live
Those whose arm has been my stay
Thou who doest all things well
Take Christ as your Savior
We are the body of Christ made incarnate
Take comfort, Christians, when your friends
Shout the glad tidings high from the hilltops
Thank God and take courage, rejoice evermore!
My blood was shed for many, taking away your sin
You are on the downward road amid a throng so gay
Take heart and praise our God
Take heed, the end is coming soon
O sailor, on lifeâ€™s stormy sea
If the pathway you travel is dreary
If the road before you offers naught but toil and pain
When you have a burden that would press you down
Sometimes we feel discouraged as on we go
Take Jesus to all the world
So many are seeking for pleasures below
Take Jesus with you, along the way
Take, Lord, receive all my liberty
Jesus, my Lord, to thee I cry
Take me as Thy tool, O Lord
Take me back. Take me back, dear Lord
O my God, you've led me through it all
I like to go away
Take me, make me
Take me, O my Father, take me
Take me to the cross   
Take me to the water
Take me where Jesus in anguish

Take my hand and lead me, Father
Take my hand, my Father
Take my heart, O loving Savior
Take my life and let it be
Holiness, holiness is what I long for
Take my life, lead me, Lord
"Take my yoke and learn of Me"
Take, O take me as I am
Yours as we stand at the table you set
On the eighth day of creation, well, the Lord looked around
Take the dark strength of our nights
Do you know the road to the cross, is your soul still lost?
Take the Saviour into your heart
We journey thru this life together
If you want to win o'er sin and strife
We are singing as we go thru the days of weal or woe
Brother, at the threshold standing
Take the word of God with you as you go
[Take the World But Give Me Jesus] (Redman)
Why this burden lingers on, if because I'm doing wrong
Take this moment, sign, and space
Take this world but give me Jesus
Take thou my hand, and lead me, Choose thou my way
Take Thou my hand and lead me
Take thou my hand and lead me unto the end
Take thou my hand, O Father
Take Thou my voice, O Lord, I give it gladly
Take Thou our minds, dear Lord
Take time to be alone with God
Take time to be holy
Many a day would brighter be
Take up his song of peace 
Behold the wood that bears our name
[Take Up Thy Cross]
What if the wind is howling round my house
Take up your cross, the Savior said
Ye harpers strike Heaven's chord in praise to Jesus our Lord
Take us as we are, O God
All like sheep we've gone astray, turned each one to His own way
Talk about a soul that's been converted
I had a little talk with Jesus
Talk with us, Lord, Thyself reveal
O mother dear, I've missed you since you have been gone
Do you walk and talk with Jesus?
Tall oaks from little acorns grow
Tall stands the Tree beside the stream
Tantum ergo Sacramentum (Holy sacrament, most holy)

Ten lepers facing constant scorn
Ten piedad de mi, oh Dios, conforme a tu bondad (Lord, have mercy on me, in accordance with your grace)

There is a beautiful City just over on the golden shore
We shall dwell where the angels are singing
There's a beautiful home 'neath a bright starry dome
In that beautiful homeland where angels dwell
After this life on earth is ended and I have crossed the great divide
I know of a name
There's a beautiful name in my childhood I heard
What shall we call him
You tell me of a city
I'm pressing my way each night and each day
[That day in Jerusalem]
That day of wrath, that direful day
That Easter day with joy was bright
A beautiful tree is standing today
That Fearful Day, that Day of Speechless Dread
Blest Savior and Guide, walk close by our side and cheer us along life's way
In this world of sin and grief, oft in vain we seek relief
Sometime, I know will sink life's sun
Oh! how sweet it will be
These are days of grief and sorrow
A heavenly city is waiting above
That I may know Him, Jesus my Saviour
There is glory in my soul today since the Saviour took my sins away

Christ the Saviour pardoned me, cleansed my heart and set me free
Underneath the silver maple
Why bear the heavy load, you're bearing
Yonder in Glory is waiting for me
That man is blessed, who fears the Lord
That man whose impious tongue denies
I read that whosoever
That mighty faith on me bestow
I wand wander back in memory to childhoodâ€™s happy days
Way back in the hills stood a little old shack
That old, old story is true
Safe were the ninety and nine in the fold
I am looking for a bright tomorrow
[That Priceless Gift]
That priceless grace
Some golden dawning
Simple is the truth that our love cannot be real
That this evening may be holy, good, and peaceful
That was a wonder-working word
Our Saviour came to earth one day
[That Where I Am, there You]
That will be a happy day when we hear our Saviour say
When the golden gates are opened
When the Christian's race is run
There's a mansion up in glory waiting now for me
When I am done with trouble and care
Soon we'll hear the Savior calling for you
When I have ended my pilgrimage here
We are often discouraged as we travel life's way
That will be a wonderful day, when our blessed Redeemer shall say
When the Saviour comes for us some wonderful day
I do not fully comprehend
And that's enough to make me sing
It all came about in seven simple days
Who is it tells me what to do
A light on my pathway to banish the night
There is a Friend to whom I cling
Jesus has promised my Shepherd to be
Happy am I each day walking the glory way
Jesus is helping me the life-crown to win
He came to live, live a perfect life
Bless'd is he the Lord who loveth
Lord! to Thee alone I raise
Lord, Thou my heart dost search and try
How long, Lord, in forgetfulness
The Lord, the earth who ruleth
O who has our report believ'd?
Are you filled with glory, brother?
The advent of our God
The age of expectation
Vain man has measured land and sea
For Jesus' glory, I'll tell the story
There's a fountain opened in the house of God
Do you see the Fountain open wide today
The Almighty spake, and Gabriel sped
I'm resting so sweetly in Jesus now
The ancient law departs
One by one we cross the river
The angel Gabriel from heaven came
There's an angel of mercy from heaven
The angel rolled the stone away!
The angel sped on wings of light
Beautiful strains of sweet music I hear
The Angels are singing; they joy and rejoice
The angels gazed to see their God
I told the Lord if He'd take my heart
All night, all day
Angel messenger sent earthward
The angel's promise to a speechless father
How precious is the gift God gave to all mankind
The angels sang one starry night
Out on the hills the Bethlehem shepherds
Under the beautiful Syrian sky
The angels that watched round the tomb
Now rise up, ye shepherds; this night is He born
â€™Twas night upon Judeaâ€™s hills
I believe in God the Father
I beleive in God the Father Almighty
We believe in God the Father (Cremos em um Pai eterno)
O Christian, gird the armor on
[The Armor of God]
O the Lord who hath spread the heavens o'er head
The world knows more
The atoning blood is flowing
The atoning work is done
Yonder--amazing sight!--I see
The awful noontide gloom is oâ€™er
O careless sinner, wake to mercy's call
Ev'ry tree beareth fruit in the world here below
The baby in a manger stall
Anointed One, Messiah, Lord
Hear me, O Redeemer, hear
Melchior, Gaspar, Balthazar
There's a place of sure deposit
In God's storehouse there are blessings for each child of grace divine
There's a royal banner given for display 
We march beneath the banner of our Saviour King
Oh, praise the Lord! my soul is filled
The Baptist bore witness to God's chosen One
The Baptist shouts on Jordan's shore
The church a garden is
In heavenly armor we'll enter the land
In heavenly armour we'll enter the land
When the battle rages fiercely below
The battle is the Lord's!
Great Apollyon, grim and awful
In the battlefield of life there is long and bitter strife
Sometimes the mists of doubt and sin
The beam that shines from Zion hill
The bearers of the living Word
[The Beatitudes]
[The Beatitudes]
Grant us this grace
And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain
Blest are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heav'n
Happy are those who are poor within
We are watching, we are waiting For the bright prophetic day
In the bible we read of a city so fair
The Lord is the radiant morning star
O beautiful land of the blessed
O I think of the beautiful garden
We read in the sacred traditions of yore
Thereâ€™s a beautiful home for the children of God
There's a beautiful, beautiful river
Thereâ€™s a home for the blest on the beautiful shore
Oh, have you not heard of a beautiful stream
Make brighter the lives that lie near to your own
And is it yet, dear Lord, a doubt
That man no guard or weapon needs
The bells of Easter sweetly ring
The day is departing, its hours are past
When the bells of home start ringing, calling me to come on home
The Bells of Salvation are ringing today
What are those bells that call to us
Dew abundant from the depths divine
Mine art thou still, and mine shalt be
I mind when I used to ha'e a lot o' wardly freens
Do you seek for a friend who is always the same
The best law that Moses proclaimed
The Lord is now my joy and song
The best of gifts is ours
Life has many dangers as we go on our way
The best that heaven could bring
How sweet was the song of the angels of light
In the east a wondrous star appeared
We have heard from that bright, that holy land
When Jesus cleansed my heart from sin
The B-I-B-L-E
The word God has spoken shall ever prevail
Who'll join our Bible band
Digging, digging for the Gold that fills our hearts with treasure
The Bible is a brilliant lamp
The Bible is a treasure book Of stories that are true
The Bible is justly esteemed
The Bible stands like a rock undaunted
There is a way of perfect peace and joy
The billows swell, the winds are high
The bird that soars on highest wing
High in the treetop's leafy bough
The birds upon the tree-tops sing their song
Come let us all who here have seen
Let Christians all with one accord rejoice
Blow the bellows, sturdy fellows
The blessed baby Jesus
O glad the wilderness for me
In faith we sing this song of thankfulness
He holds in remembrance
I'm bound for the kingdom of glory and song
On the blessed Rock of Ages
Oh, the wonders of the greatest blessing!
The blessing cup that we bless
The blessing of a night's repose
O God, be thy Anointed Son 
May blessings be upon you, precious baby
Praise waits in Zion, Lord, for Thee
The blest memorials of thy grief
Great Saviour, born of David's race
I was lost in sin and shame
The blood of Christ, Thy spotless Lamb
Come shout and sing, make heaven ring
For centuries in Egypt
What would a helpless sinner do
The ground was stained with sacred blood
On the cross of Calvary our blessed Savior died
There is a blood-washed multitude, a mighty army strong
The blood that Jesus shed for me
The blood that Jesus once shed for me
We are one in the bond of love
How sweet this bond of perfectness,
O sweet will of God! thou hast girded me round
Jesus, the Son of God, was bound
There is a Book, a book more blest
The bookâ€”let all bow down and read
God's Word is like a hammer
O precious Book! upon thy leaves
The book of nature open lies
Show me Thy love, teach me Thy will
The bosom where I oft have lain
The bounteous Lord my pastures shall prepare
The growing limbs of God the Son
Last night as I was laid and slept
Many are the lonely hearts in this old world today
[The Branch that Bends with Clustered Fruit]
The bread and the wine are here
The bread is broken, you are whole
O why should I from hunger sore
[The Bread that We Break]
The breaking morn comes back to bless
Like the glory of an evening sunset
Thou Breath from still eternity
The breath of God, which ev'ry heart
I constant care will take
Praise, my soul, the Lord in glory
O who is she whose wondrous beauty
Thus speaks the Bride whose feet have trod
The Bridegroom comes! My soul, awake
The Bridegroom cometh! overhead
Dark fall the hours this winter-tide
We read in the Bible, that the Bridegroom will come
The Bridegroom meets His bride
The Bridegroom soon will call us
The Bridegroom soon will call us
The bright and morning star
The bright wind is blowing, the bright wind of heaven
The brightest morning of the year
The brightness of God's glory
How can we live as Christians here
When the chord of life is broken
Have you read the story of the Cross
The Potter saw a vessel
Hark! Hark! The Bugle calls!
The builder, whom true wisdom sways
Oh! the bulldog on the bank
Is there a heart that is willing to lay
The burden of Dumah! A voice out of Seir
Oh! the Christmas bells are ringing
Ah, what can I do
The buses are a-comin', oh, yes
If I were a butterfly, I'd thank you, Lord
There's a happy childhood home, in my memory I can see
Far and near the fields are teeming
The call is clear and simple
O'er the world the call is sounding
Jesus came the grace to prove
Ho! ev'ry thristy, longing soul!
The call of God resounding
Who will serve today, when our Captain leads the way
Come home! Come home!
The call of the Christ rings out today
Hear the call of the Master
Hear the voice of Jesus calling
Golden morning breaks o'er the harvest field
There's a clear call ringing over land and sea
Up the Calv'ry road I travel
A goodly land mine eyes behold
The candle of hope we light in this hour
Come all ye Christian soldiers, hear ye the call
The care the eagle gives her young
They brought their sick, he made them well
Long ago in little Nazareth lived the Son of Man
The cause is thine, Lord Jesus Christ
The caution is not vain
The Cedar of Lebanon, plant of renown
Long my stubborn will kept saying to the Master
Israel in ancient days
The challenge comes, the trumpet sounds
Hear ye hear the challenge of Christ
Idyllic beaches break the waves
I love yon pale blue sky; it is the floor
The Chariot! the chariot! its wheels roll in fire
The chariots of the Lord are strong
The chief of sinners I may be
The child has now its Father seen
Cold was the day when in a garden bare
The children come, not sure where they are going
The children of Jerusalem they welcomed Christ the King
The children of the Hebrews
The children's angels always view
Above earth's din and turmoil
Go call ye the children, we want them all
Jesus is the children's Friend, Children's friend, children's friend
A happy band of children
Holy Jesus, ev'ry day
Oh what can I do for my Lord?
Chiming and rhyming bells are ringing
The Choirs of Ransomed Israel
The angels sing around the stall
Darkness cast its shadows over all the world
The Christ is my Guide
In far away Galilee, long, long ago
The Christ on Olive's mount in prayer
The Christ who died but rose again
When trackless wastes before us lie
Honor and happiness unite 
I've traveled this pathway for many long years
Brother, you may work for Jesus
Dear Lord, let not thine anger rise
O fight the good fight like a soldier
My Captain sounds the alarm of war
There's a call comes ringing thro'out earth's domain
The Christian warrior
When pity prompts me to look round 
Never let the good despair
Sleep on, beloved, sleep, and take thy rest
Tho' I know I must go thro' the valley low
Ah, wretched souls, who strive in vain
Hark! the bells of Christmas ringing!
All hail to Christ, the Christmas King
Long ago, in Bethlehem's manger
Again has merry Christmas come
There's a dear little church in the village
The church is wherever God's people are gathered
The church is our safe haven,
In the Church of Jesus only
The church of Christ, which he has hallowed here
The church of Christ in every age
The Church of Christ, that He hath hallowed here
The church of God must now prevail
The church of God a kingdom is
There's a little brick church in my childhood home
Within Thy temple, Lord
The Church triumphant in Thy love
There's a church within us, O Lord
The light of eventide now shines
The church's one foundation
The little flock, on Zion's hill
Our loved ones and friends are fast passing away
We shall be forever blest in that home of peace and rest
We see the many works of men and marvel o'er and o'er
Over by the crystal river, far above the blue sky
There's a bright eternal clime, and I'm going there sometime
The city is alive, O God
[The City of Doom]
There's a promise recorded in God's holy word
I am thinking today of a home far away
Oh, they tell me of a City over yonder
The city of our God, Jerusalem the bright
[The City of the Living God]
[The City Street is Dark]
Jerusalem! thou glorious City-height
There's a City of many bright mansions
I am going to a city bright and fair
When they crucified my Savior On the cross of Calvary
I believe the Bible teaching
Oh, now I see the crimson wave
There's a cleft in the Rock of ages
[The Clever Accountant]
The Lord our Salvation and Light
To Him who sits upon the throne
As of old when the hosts of Israel
For so long the sky was clouded and no light was over head
The clouds of judgment gather
Bright the stars at night
O spread the tidings 'round, wherever man is found
In the coming judgment day
I am watching for the coming of the King
Thereâ€™s a glorious kingdom waiting
In the resurrection morning You will see the Savior coming
Ye people of the Lord bowed with grief
Lift your eyes unto the heavens, ye who wait the Lord's return
Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away
Why is the heaven-descended mind
Come sinners to Jesus no longer delay
From Edom whom see I returned
Be glad, rejoice, Hope's golden light
Oh, glory to God!
The consecration hour is nigh
There is a holy sacrifice
How sweet is the language of love
Dear Jesus here comes and knocks at thy door
Lift your hearts, redeem'd ones, thoâ€™ the way be long
The King rejoiceth in Thy strength
One, two, three, God takes care of me
[The Countless Stars of Heaven]
The country lies in deep repose
My soul, there is a country
By and by we'll walk in light supernal
O Lord, I have loved the fair beauty
Just a baby in a cradle
[The Crafty Foe]
And God said the sun would shine
The crimson blush of morning glows
On the cross of Calvary the price of sin was fully paid
There flows a stream of crimson red
Are thy toils and woes increasing
Still the cross is brightly glowing
My Lord with his affliction
The cross for only a day
The cross of Christ shall conquer
The cross is on our brow
Be ye not discouraged, children of the King
Adown thru all the years before us
To Calvary ascending
On the cross of Calvary
Upon the cross of Calvary
A heart, O God, that pain nor sorrow tireth
The cross of Christ inspires my heart
Come, O God, renew your people
In the days long ago, there in anguish and woe
Toiler for Jesus, be thou faithful
Despised and rejected
Are you marching in the way of our King
The morning hangs her signal
The crucible for silver
Borne away in mind and spirit
Is thy cruse of comfort failing?
Millions in heathen lands, over the sea
All the world this day is crying
I would be Thine; my weary, sinful heart
Hark! A plaintive cry comes ringing
How can I repay the Lord
And must the cross attend my way
The darkness now is over
The dawn is sprinkling in the east
The dawn of victory
The day expires
The day fades into night
The day hath dawnedâ€”the day of days
The day hath now an ending
The day is coming- God has promised
The day is done
The day is done!
The day is ended, Ere I sink to sleep
The day is far spent, O Master
The day is fast approaching, By prophets long foretold
The day is gently sinking to a close
For words and deeds enshrined in granite tombs
The Day is Near, the Judgment is at Hand
The day is past and gone
The Day is Past and Over
The day is surely drawing near
The day must come, the judgment day
The Savior of this sinful world
The day of God is now at hand
The day of grace is rolling on
When earth and all its glories from us shall pass away
When we meet some glory morning, wearying crowns with bright adorning
Lift your heads, ye friends of Jesus
Lo! we see the sign appearing
The day of Pentecost draws nigh
The day of praise is done
The nations are breaking
Now is the day of salvation, The future no promise contains
Hark! from the sky, the trump proclaims
The day of the Lord--the day of salvation
May I stand, O Lord, in this holy place
The day of wrath, that dreadful day
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth
Behold! behold! behold! the King cometh
Ring, ring the bells, the joyful bells
The day the Christ-child's tender eyes
The day, the dreadful day draws nigh
The day, the solemn day shall come
The day the universe was started
The day will come when shadows will have drifted
The day you gave us, Lord, is ended
The daylight fades
The days and years of time are fled
It is time to seek salvation
The days are surely coming
The days of Paradise were few
Remember thy great Creator in the days of thy youth
The days that were, the days that are
The dayspring from on high on us is shining
The name of a loved one in tenderness spoken
When I think of Him who hath lov'd me so
Oh, the joy I have in giving light to others while I'm living
'Twill be wonderful in heaven when the millions I shall see
There are many touching stories
Come let us go and die with him
Did Jesus in the garden lie
The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord
For me Christ Jesus was crucified
It's your decision who you will live for
E'er the blue Heav'ns were stretch'd abroad
The deluge, at the Almighty's call
There's a wonderful love, that is precious to me
Six weary hours extended
The desert shall rejoice
The desolate Messiah dies
O the men are so easy, the devil said
The Dewy Freshness From the Furnace Flings
[The Disciple's Prayer]
Constrained by their Lord to embark
Strange that so much of heaven and hell
O Thou who madest water wine
When winds far-blown from realms of pain
All within are love and gladness
You've wandered far o'er deserts wild
Sinner no hope while living in sin
Will you open the door of your heart tonight?
The double-minded I abhor
Of sinful Adam's numerous race
[The Dragon]
The dreadful day is come
The duteous day now closeth
Nowâ€”borne upon the still, the boundless deep
God dwells in Heaven: He rules above
Mother, I'm tired and I fain would be sleeping
The time has come dear papa
Rest from the warfare, the battle is over
Bright the world and fair the flowers
The early morn with Jesus
The earth and all that dwell therein
The earth and its riches abundantly stored
The earth and the fulness with which it is stored
The earth and the riches with which is it stored
The earth and the riches with which it is stored
The earth belongs to God alone
The earth belongs to the Lord
[The Earth Belongs to the Lord God]
The earth belongs to the Lord
The earth is full of love
[The Earth is the Lord's]
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. Creation reminds us, O God, of your love
The earth is the Lord's
The earth is the Lord's and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein
The earth is turning toward the sun
The earth Jehovah's is
The earth was dark until You spoke
The earth with all that dwell therein
What do the Easter lilies say
The eastern sages sought their Lord
Who knocketh now at the wicket gate?
The Emperor Napoleon had twenty thousand men
[The Empty-Handed Fishermen]
The end of all things is at hand
When I come to the end of my journey
A beautiful mansion resplendent with gold
Has the journey been long? Has the valley been dark?
When I come to the end of the long, long road
The ends of all the earth shall hear
Father, in us now revealing
The eternal gifts of Christ the King
The eternal gifts of Christ the King
The eternal Sovereign from on high
O sing a new song to the Lord
[The Evening Is Here]
In the evening of life, when the sun goes down
This world of strife is not our home
In times of doubt and care
Wearily my spirit sinketh
Underneath us are the arms eternal
[The Everlasting Lord Is King]
Come, O my soul, my every power awaking
Thou art the everlasting Word
Why do the tribes and nations rage
Praise ye the Lord, His saints
My God, I will extol Thee And ever bless Thy Name
If the world were mine and all its store
I have said goodby to the sinful past
One we become, no longer strangers
The eyes of all wait upon you
The fading day adorns the west
We in this tabernacle mourn 
The faith that Christ embraces
The faith that God believeth
The faith that saves the soul
[The Faithful Are Kept As the Mountains That Never Shall Move]
O look at the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,
Almighty Sov'reign, gracious Lord
The faithless world promiscuous flows
Rebellious man how hast thou fell
There's a book in memory that is sacred to us all
God of caring, bind us firmly
You will notice we say "brother and sister"
Come and fill our homes with Your presence
Farewell my brethren in the Lord
Tho' shadows may o'er our path appear
The Father of love who is seeking the lost
The Father we will ever praise
All the little children, Wherever they may be
The Father's holy eye
The Father's love to man so free
Jesus came from heav'n above, came to save me
Mourner, Christmas comes for thee
[The Feast]
The feast of love is waiting
Far and near the fields are golden
Lift up your eyes upon the land
The fields are white unto the harvest, Lord
The fiery sun now rolls away
Where is the God of Shadrach? Where
The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out
Awake! awake! ye saints of light!
The final call will come some day
There will be a great reunion, When the trump of God shall sound
When I was helpless and needy in this cold world of sin
The Savior came one summer day
There was silence in Bethlehemâ€™s fields that night
The first day of creation
The first day of the week
The first Eternal Mind was law to all
The first Nowell the angel did say
The first of all apostles
The first one ever, oh ever to know
The first one to know what the Word was to be
Jesus, the perfect picture of the unseen God
Bless'd is he who never taketh
Surely, it is God who saves me; I will trust in him
[The flaming banners of our King]
The fleeting day is nearly gone
The flocks were wrapped in slumber
The flowers now awaken, refreshed by morning dew
The flowers slowly awaken
The flowers that in the garden grow
The foes of Zion quake for fright
The fool in's heart saith, there's no God
The fool speaks in his heart
The fool speaks in his heart
The foolish in their hearts deny
The foolish in their hearts exclaim
When descending from the sky
At the Last Supper with His disciples
Behold, My bride, how fair My mouth, Mine eyes
Now angels down have flown, now glory bright has shone
There'll be a time in your life friend
The fountain in its source
Jesus' fragrant flowers
How free and boundless is the grace
It thus befell me on a day
Thro' the long, long years He is near you
I have found a Friend I long have sought
If your soul is despairing and for you none is caring
Since I turned from sin and selfish ways
Jesus, our brother, strong and good
When I was burdened down with care
The man that fears the Lord
There are friendships that have lasted thru a lifetime
The fruit of love, the gift of life
The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace
The fruit of the Spirit is love for our sharing
We walk in the Spirit together
Out of God's fullness, long long ago
The fullness which the world affords
The future is bright for me
There lived a man in Galilee
We shall great the friends we love
The garden of the world, the paradise we share
The news of salvation rings over the way
The gate of life stands wide
O ye who walk on the downward way
As we travel on the road together, children of the heavenly King
What dost thou bring me, O my Queen?
The gift of grace, who will refuse
Though I may speak with bravest fire
The gifts Christ freely gives
His gifts are greater than my dreams
[The Gifts We Bring]
The gifts we bring are small
With our hearts we give Thee praise
List to the glad bells now ringing
When I shall leave this world below and I'm safe on heaven's shore
Another year has pass'd away
Where hast thou gleaned today, Christian
The gloomy night to morning yields
Glorious scenes will greet our eyes
The glorious gates of righteousness
[The Glorious God of Heaven]
There's a message ringing over land and sea
Heed the glorious invitation, come
The glorious light of Zion
In latter days JEHOVAH's mount
The glorious subject of my tuneful song
The glorious universe around
The days are often dreary, and we are worn and weary
I love to sing and tell the story of my home in endless glory
When I reach the lonely Jordan at the ending of life's way
The glory bound train is leaving for home
There's a happy land of joy supernal, over the rolling tide
There's a happy band of marchers
At the crossing of the river Jordan
Just a few more tears and heart aches
I am walking the King's highway, 'tis the glory land road
All thru the journey here we meet shadows
The glory of Israel is not the law
[The Glory of Our God and King]
The glory of our King was seen
When the glory of the Lord fill this holy temple
They built a house of beauty rare
The glory of the Lord, The heavens declare abroad
The glory of the spring, how sweet
The glory of these forty days
Lord, we glorify you and we lift you up
Don'char hear that choo, choo, chooing
The glow of a star over Bethlehem
The God of Abraham praise
The God of all eternity
God of power and might
[The God of Grace Is Ours]
The God of harvest praise
The God of heaven thunders
Gentler than air, wilder than wind
The God of holiness and love
The God of Israel is real
The God of love, to earth He came
The God of love will sure indulge
The God of might dispels the night
For all the tired and needy
The God of nature and of grace
The God of peace, who from the dead
Let all the earth Jehovah fear
Come, now, O God of second chances
I don't know how God hangs the world on nothing
The God of us all is our Father
The God of your forefathers praise
[The God Who Placed the Sun and Moon]
The God who sends us forth
The God who sings
The God who sits entroned on high
O they tell me of a country far beyond the starry sky
On that bright and golden shore
When we reach the Land of Gladness
The golden gates are lifted up
Over valley and over plain
The golden homelights gleam and glow
On some happy glad tomorrow
In the realms of grace there's a holy place
The golden light of Heaven now shines upon my soul
Once my heart was filled with its grief and fear
The golden sun lights up the sky
The golden sunbeams with their joyous gleams
There are armies contending in battle array
The good man's steps are led aright
Lift up your hearts, Immanuel's friends
A certain traveler on his way
How kind the good Samaritan
Good Shepherd, Thou who gavest
My gentle Lamb, O come to me
When the little lambs are roving
There is never a lamb that strays so far
My Savior I know wherever I go
The Lord is strong to help the weak
O to JEHOVAH give ye thanks
The Saviour above, in wonderful love
Onward, ever onward
The gospel bells are ringing clear
The Spirit and the Bride say, Come
The blessed Redeemer doth beckon you to come
You have had an invitation to the Gospel-feast
The Master is calling for reapers today
The gospel of the grace of God
Hail the gospel jubilee
Loud let the tuneful trumpet sound
I can see the great need of the pure gospel light
O hear the glad tidings of peace and good will
[The Gospel of Your Grace]
From the throne our dear Lord came, revealing God's word
The gospel ship is sailing, sailing, sailing
See, the gospel ship is proudly sailing
The Gospel shows the Father's grace
My friends and my neighbors that live in this place
Holy God, in love, became
The gospel train is coming, I hear it just at hand
There's a train that soon is coming, headed for the glory land
Hark! don't you hear the trumpet sound
The gospel trumpet sounds, Let those that hear obey
We have found the road to our eternal home
Hear the gospel's joyful sound
The grace of God unbounded is
Clothed with sweet humility
The grace of Jesus Christ our Lord
The grace of life is theirs
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (Overholt)
JEHOVAH, we in Hymns of Praise
The gracious Lord is still, to me
Oh the grand old Duke of York 
Christian soldier, worn with service
The grandest songs, the sweetest strains
The grass and flowers, which clothe the field
To our most glorious GOD on high
The grave itself a garden is
O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High
The great and skillful Master
The great Creator of the worlds
The great design if not Jehovah bless
The great forerunner of the morn
'Tis so sweet to meet with loved ones in reunion down here
There will be a great home-coming over in the glory-land
The great Jehovah, who shall dare
You are under condemnation, careless sinner
Soon the trumpet sound appalling
The great love of God
There is coming a day when to judgment we'll go
Reaper, the harvest is waiting
Take my heart, O Great Refiner
I will make the great surrender
May the Lord our God be with you
John, in a vision, saw the day
Why dost Thou pass unheeded
If I speak with the tongue of an angel
Tho' I speak with the tongues of men and angels
O the all important question must be settled while you live
The greatest thing in all my life is knowing You
The greatest walk we'll ever take
I think about the ocean with waves so high
Once again we celebrate the Christmas time
The ground on which this day we stand
Thou Jehovah art my Shepherd
Is it to me the Master sends
O'er the gleaming desert sand
I am thinking today of that home far away
We've often heard how Jesus came upon this earth to die
I know I love thee better, Lord,
Repeat the story o'er and o'er
When I was far from Jesus, and sinning every day
The cross! The cross! The blood-stain'd cross!
There is a spot to me more dear
All your works praise you
May God's light shine ever upon you
All your creatures shall thank you, O Lord
With bread from heaven, feed us
When the mountain of sin rose above me
Close, close to the side I'm clinging
I vision the hands of the Savior
The hands that first held Mary's child
The hands that were nailed on the cross for me
At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords
Extensive promise! O what hopes divine
O Blessed Man who walks not in
O could we read our int'rest here
The happy Christmas comes once more
Happy the man of heavenly birth
Happy the man whose will is bow'd
The happy little Skylark
The happy sunshine all is gone
There's a land far away in the regions of day
There's a harbor bright and fair
As pilgrims we're traveling through a land of sorrow and tears
Eternal Father, by whose hand
This is the field; the world below
The harvest is here: earth's bounty we bring!
Many souls now in sin drifting farther each day
The harvest is white, but the lab'rers are few
Gather with patience
Onward all ye Christian reapers in the harvest of the Lord
Some day we shall reap what we have sown
We must study God's Word to show ourselves approved
The head that once was crowned with thorns
On the cross crucified, in great sorrow He died
O Holy and mighty and marvellous Word
The heart break of Jesus, oh, who can reveal
There is a story, story so tender
When the music fades, all is swept away
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
The heart that was broken on Calv'ry's tree
[The Heartfelt Praise of God Proclaim]
The heathen, Lord, thy heritage
The heathen perish
There's a train for heaven, that will run the whole way through
The heavenly child in stature grows
We're wanderers here like sheep from the fold
There's a City up in heaven I know
The heavenly gales are blowing
And will the Lord thus condescend
The heavenly King must come
I love to think of the heavenly land
Rejoice, my soul, the trumpet sounds
All hail to Thee! All hail to Thee!
Before I came to Jesus My heart was full of sin
Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell
I do not seek a life of ease
The heavenly Word proceeding forth
The heav'ns above declare
The heavens above declare God's praise
[The Heavens Are Singing, Are Singing and Praising]
The heavens are telling the Lord's endless glory
The heavens declare the glory of God
The heav'ns declare the glory of the Lord
The heavens declare the glory of God, the skies proclaim
The heavens declare the glory of God, The firmament showeth His handiwork
The heavens declare your glory
The heavens invite mine eye
The heavens shall declare the glory of his name
The Heav'ns declare thy Glory, LORD
The heav'ns on high abroad declare
How beautiful are, how beatiful are on the mountains
At the close of the day when the hamlet is still
With our banners waving proudly in the light
[The Heroes of Scripture]
One place have I in heaven above
In a time of trouble, in a time forlorn
See the gloomy, gathering cloud
Infinite love! that first began
We place You on the highest place
I have left the wilderness beyond the rolling tide
It is a wondrous and a lofty road
I'm walking the highway that leads me up to the glory land fair
I'm on the highway home
What a wonderful story, I'm singing today
The hill of Zion yields
The hills of life which you must climb
Beyond the ills and toils of life
God is king forever, let the nations tremble
I am safe, whatever may betide me
The holly and the ivy 
God the Father, God the Son
The Holy Children Boldly Stand
The Holy Ghost is come
[The Holy Gifts of God]
The Holy Heart was broken
What though this weary earth-born flesh lie fettered
The Holy One of Israel
First of all you must understand this
Hark! I hear a glad song ringing
Love of the Father, love of God the Son
I've listed in the holy war, I'm bound for the throne
As it fell out one May morning
The Holy Word of God
As I journey thru the gloom in the shadow of the tomb
There's a home far away in the realms of the blest
The mind saith to the soul
There's a beautiful home in that city bright and fair
Where findeth the soul its true rest
I hear of a city, a heavenly home
In my Father's house there are mansions bright
There is a beautiful country, 'tis the home of the soul
Brother do we live the way that we sing about day after day
Often after a day of toiling
In the valley so fair by the side of the hill
There's a home beyond this vale of tears
The Homeland! the Homeland!
O Homeland! O Homeland!
There is a Land of endless day
Christ is coming for His own, and He'll call us one by one
Jesus walks with me and my heart is free
Into this world of sin and shame Jesus my Lord and Savior came
There's no other one who is able to save
Lay hold on the hope set before you
The Hour has come, foretold since time began
The hour of my departure's come
The hour will quickly come
The hours of day are over
In thine abode
Arise, O Lord, our God, arise
I was glad when they said unto me
The humble hold your kingdom's key
Grace rules below, and sits enthroned above
O Lord on whom I do depend
I am thinking today of a little old home
I know that my Redeemer
In the human creature
The impious atheist, in his folly proud
The virgin's promised Son is born
The infant Priest was holy born
I am thinking today of a wonderful love
The ink is black, the page is white
Distracted by the world's concerns
An inner voice is speaking so sweetly to my soul
Sinner, go, will you go
Jesus once lay in the manger
Come, let us sing to the Lord
Tho' Christ had borne my load of sin
In visions grand I fondly view
The Jesus, the Jesus road
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God 
I've found the joy of full salvation
Would you know the joy of salvation, deep in your soul today?
The joy of the Gospel invites us today
The joy of the Lord is my strength
A worthy song, I wish to sing
The joyful morn, my God, is come
Hark, hark! methinks I hear a voice
Before the throne All will be known
The long last note has sounded
A terrible scene is before me
There's an awful day approaching
Some people of earth of excellent worth
Hear the call for volunteers
Long I sought to find peace thru the works of the law
The just will live in the presence of the Lord
The keeper of a vineyard dreamed
His saints shall live, and to the King
O pilgrim so lonely and weary
Let heathen rage, and kings combine
The King, in thy Strength
The King is among us
The market place is empty
Rejoice! rejoice! our King is coming!
The King is on His journey
The King has called for volunteers
The King, O Lord, with Songs of Praise
The King, O LORD! with Songs of Praise
Oh, my soul is all aflame
Who is the King of glory? What shall we call him?
The King of glory, the King of kings
The King of Glory we proclaim
The king of heaven a feast has made
Daylight is breaking, earth is awaking
The King of Kings, Christ Jesus reigns
The King of love is my delight
The king rejoices in your strength
The King shall come when morning dawns
The King shall in thy strength rejoice, O Lord; what shouts of praise
With gladness we toil in the work of the Lord
The kingdom of God is like
The kingdom of God is justice and peace
[The Kingdom of God Grows Silently]
The kingdom of God is justice and joy
A form of words, though e'er so sound
The Lord, our God, is good to all
What are you seeking day by day
Blessed are you in sorrow and grief
The kingdom of our God is like
There's a theme that is sweet to my mem'ry,
This world is fair, this life is sweet
The kingdom Satan founded
The kingdom we inherited
The kingdoms of earth pass away one by one
The kingdoms of this world are become
Praise to Jesus voicing
Youth looking upward and onward today
When the King comes back from the far-off land
On the highway of the King
[The Kings of the East Are Riding]
My heart was closed to Jesus
The Lamb, the Lamb
Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
The Lamb appears to wipe our tears
Lamb, Thy white-robed people feeding
To the Lamb upon the throne we offer songs of praise
The Lamb we follow! Brothers, sisters
The Lamb's high banquet called to share
The Lamb's high banquet we await
O Lord turn not away thy face
A weary pilgrim sat
Down to that gloomy stream
Angel bands are sweetly singing
The land before them, where to choose
There's a land beyond the river, where the billows never roll
I stand by the lonely breakers
[The Land Is Dry]
There's a land of never ending beauty
O what blessings Jesus has for me
There is a land to which we're going, when this earthly life is o'er
There's a land of fadeless beauty where my soul shall rest
We are pressing onward day by day
It was as if upon His breast
There's a land of wondrous story over on the hills of glory
A land there is beyond the sky
Soon the day will dawn when this life is gone
Time is flying fast, earthly things can't last
There's a land of sweet forever
There is one thing I ask of God, for this I long
Thru the night of regret and sorrow
Do you know the language of Canaan?
The last dread trump is sounding!
'Tis sad to part with precious loved ones
From the falter of breath, through the silence of death
Come, immortal King of Glory!
Take the last kiss - the last forever!
The last lovely morning, All blooming and fair
Cursed be the man for ever cursed
Did the Eternal, from his throne
As children of our God we're sisters, brothers
The law of God is good and wise
The law of the Lord is perfect
The leaves around me falling
Legion was my name, by nature
[The Leper's Face]
[The Leper's Soul Was No Less Scarred]
I sit upon the mantel shelf
Do we want to go to heav'n
There's a light in Heaven's window
Jesus Christ the King of Glory will return to earth again
There's a light from above filled with wondrous love
'Tis Christmas night, the pure snow a flock unnumbered lies
Jesus, the Light of Bethlehem
When Jesus died, the world to save
The light of Christ
All men must be born again
Does your sad heart for pardon yearn
Since I am a child of my heavenly King
O let the light spread far and wide
We have fixed our minds on Jesus
When bowed down with burdens and lost in the night
O the light of the cross leads out over the way
The light of the morning is breaking
The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin
The light of the world is Jesus! It shines with a radiance beaming so bright
The light of the world is Jesus
There's a beautiful light shining over the sea
The light that comes with day break
There's a light that never fails
The lighthouse founded on a rock
The lily is the gem of all
Beside the old stone fountain, there stands a linden tree
Your life is o'ershadowed with trouble
He's coming on the clouds
The lion that on Samson roared
O Lord, Have mercy upon us
There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
Come into our garden fair
"Gunk, gunk" went the little green frog one day
There's a little painted church standing by the way
Sometimes I fall to thinking how
You are the bread of life
Then cometh Simon Peter following him
The living God my Shepherd is
The living principle of grace
"Follow Me", our Saviour said
The lone, wild bird in lofty flight
In the lonely moment of temptation
The long expected hour draws near
Since I started for the kingdom
Ever are my longing eyes
The night is dark, the waves run high
The Lord Almighty spoke the word
The Lord and King of All Things
When the soul is oppressed by the heat of the day
The Lord again to earth appears
The Lord ascendeth up on high
The Lord at first had Adam made
[The Lord Be Near Us As We Pray]

I woke, and the night was passing
In every cloud of pain and loss

The morning star on high is glowing
The morning stars in concert sang
The morning sun is brightly beaming
The morning sun shines from the east
There are mothers with beautiful features
The mountain of Jehovah's house
The mountains shall depart
There's a melody in my heart that will never depart
Lord, how Mysterious are thy Ways!
One day I made a snowman
The myst'ry hidden from the eyes
The mystery now unfolds
The name of Christ, how sweet it sounds
That name to me sounds ever sweet
There is a name, a name above all others
The name of Jesus is so sweet,
The Name of our God
O ever sweet and holy name
The Name, the Name o'er every name
The Name which I whisper as morning time breaks
Straight is the way, and often very thorny
O Master of the narrow way
O the changes, constant changes
Because the Lord is my Shepherd, I have everything that I need (Carmichael)

The new church year again is come
There are friends, kind friends, that to me are dear
O there is glory in my happy soul
[The New Jerusalem]
I'll see the new Jerusalem when Christ to earth does come
We shall have a new name in that land
It thrills my soul to hear the songs of praise
The nicest story ever told
[The Night of Nights]
The night will soon be ending;
The noblest subject swells my lofty lay
The north wind is tossing the leaves
The numberless gifts of God's mercies
When we enter the portals of glory, And the great host of ransomed we see
One is for the wond'rous land in which we live
The ocean hath no danger
We are out upon an ocean
Lord, take my all
See that sister dressed so fine
'Mid the storms of doubt and unbelief we fear
There's a volume that's dearer than any book
O how well I remember in the old fashioned days
They call me old-fashioned because I believe
Today we find so many false religions
I have good news to bring and that is why I sing
I'm gonna take a trip in the good old gospel ship
Oft in silent pensive yearning
How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood
While others sing their "songs of love and war"
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
There is no song like the old, old song
Come, children, oh, will you listen
Oh, for that flame of living fire
It has shown me a Saviour
I would like to go just for a day, hear the people sing the old time way
Hush! the year is dying
The old year now hath pass'd away
The one born blind is silent
What a true and precious friend
Thou art the One that I love
Thine are the rivers: Thine, O God, the power
The one thing needful be our choice
The one thing needful, that good part
Praise ye the Lord, His praise proclaim
The one who dwells in God as his abode
There was one who had wandered away
[The One You Love is Ill]
[The Ones Who Ask the Questions]
There is a way by Calvary
You mean more to me than any words could say
The only path to peace is peace
The only Son from heaven
The only Son of God on high
An open door, an empty tomb
I saw a fountain opened wide
In the Bible we are told
Out in the woods where the big trees grow
When we have reached the heav'nly plains
Sitting, sadly thinking, dreaming
There lies a land of glory
Let the palms wave on this most happy day!
If we're faithful to our calling
I will sing a song of the home beyond the blue
The past no longer in my power
He was made sin, the curse he took
You are drifting with the tide, onward down the stream you glide
[The Past Stood Once As Witness]
My brethren from my heart beloved
Though the skies are gray all along your way
When the path is dark and steep the road
Wherever Jesus bids me go
The path is very narrow but I'll follow
The path lies straight and shining
The path of sorrow, and that path alone
[The Path of the Righteous]
Send out Thy truth O god of Light
There's a pathway that leads thro' the valley of life
[The Pawnbroker]
Whatever is true, whatever is just
The peace of God protects our hearts
The peace of God surpassing thought
[The Peace of Mind That Christ Can Bring]
The peace of the Lord be always with you
The Peace of the Lord be always with you, I greet you in his name
Like the fragrance of flowers
Tale of tenderness unfathomed
Come see the power of Christ our king
The people called Christians
The people came from everywhere
Blessed, blessed are the poor in spirit
The Lord will come some day
The people that in darkness lay
The people who walked in darkness
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light
The law that the Lord has ordained is perfect
The perfect law we fail to keep
The perfect righteousness of God
Unto God's House in olden day
[The Pharisee and the Sinner]
[The Pilgrim Church of God]
The pilgrim spirit moveth
Upward toils the eager pilgrim
Hail! happy Pilgrims, whence came ye
O happy band of pilgrims
Saviour, Friend, to the end
I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow, Cast out in this wide world to roam
On the King's highway marched a pilgrim band
On Life's wild sea, He pilots me
As I sail life's rugged sea
Wonderful place called Calvary
There is a place of rest
To that holy place where Jesus met me, took away my heavy load of sin
A precious rose-bud, plucked from earth
Weary wand'rer o'er the main
God of my salvation, hear
The poorest of the poor are we
Behold that great and awful day
As clay within the potterâ€™s hand
Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior,
Take me, mold me, use me
Rest from longing and desire
We know in days of long ago
The pow'r of sin no longer
Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Lord, I come to you; Let my heart be changed
The powers of earth and hell combine
The powers of wrath and darkness rage
The praise of the Lord endures forever
I will sing the Lord with a praise song
The praises of my tongue
The praises of that saint we sing
The praises of thy wonders, Lord
Thy speech, O LORD, I heard with fear
The prayers of my mother
[The Prayers of the Saints]
The praying spirit breathe
Brethren I bid you all farewell
Oh! the blood, the precious blood
The precious blood of Jesus
On the cross, Jesus shed His blood
In the Bible we read of a city
The precious seed of weeping
Praise the Lord! there's sunlight in my happy soul today
Standing on the promise it is right, I know
The presence of the Lord is here
The presence of thy grace impart
The price is paid
Rapture my bosom is swelling
To hail thy rising, Sun of life
The Prince of peace is come! Ye nations, shout and sing
The princely city passing by
The pathway is often so dreary I scarce can see
If we do our duty during pilgrim days
The Prodigal's returned
The abyss of many a former sin
Far, far away from my loving Father
See the rash youth, defiled with sin
Oh bitter memory! What shame, what vain regrets!
Here feast I at my Father's board
O blessed grief     
O ye heavy laden and distrest
I used to hear the promise
[The Promise of the Holy Spirit]
The promise of the Lord
The promise which the Saviour made
Far from these narrow scenes of night
The promised Star appeareth
The prophets came to Israel
The prophet's voice comes down the years
The steps of those whom he approves
Come, ye that love the Lord indeed, Who are from sin and bondage freed
God will our strength and refuge prove
The pure and peaceful mind
If there's one that's more dear than another
I long to run aright this earthly race
The race of Godâ€™s anointed priests
There is great rejoicing round the throne of God, yonder in realms above
The radiant morn hath passed away
The radiant sun shines in the skies
The rain is raining day and night
When you feel you can never carry on any more
In fury the storms of life may blow
He sends the rainbow, a lovely rainbow
[The Ranks of Death with Trophy Grim]
God's love divine has won my heart
Hark! we hear the music of the reapers as they gather golden grain
After the sowing of sin is all done
The reason for living is not wealth or things
E'er since beneath God's open sky
In the early, early morning, beyond the islands green
If you had not saved me
When flowers are red and gold and white
There's a mighty reformation sweeping o'er the land,
He who on earth as man was known
To the regions beyond I must go
[The Reign of God]
Christ, in that night he was betrayed Took bread, gave thanks, it break and said
Lo! what a rapturous joy possessed
Amen! pow'r wisdom, might and thanks
The Lamb is worthy that was slain
LORD, Thou all honour, glory, pow'r
Master, how shall I bless Thy name
Happy songs I sing of my Lord and King
The resting time is coming
The resurrected Christ be your guide
I am Alpha, says the Savior
They laid the Saviour in a grave
[The Resurrection and the Life]
The Resurrection light is all around
When the trump of God shall sound From the lonely grave and mound
On the resurrection morning, we will see our Saviour coming
In the great and final morning when the trump of God shall sound
On the resurrection morning, when the dead in Christ shall rise
Pleased we read in sacred story
Yes, the Redeemer rose
Safe home, safe home in port
The ribs and terrors in the whale
The rice of life from heaven came
In what confusion earth appears
Not all the treasures of the earth
The right hand of God
A cry, a wild and piercing cry
Work when you work
The wicked, watching for their prey
The rights of justice hear O Lord
O breath of God, come fill this place
The risen Christ, who walks on wounded feet
Hushed ev'ry bird that sings
The risen Lord today is king
The risen Saviour stands
The rising God forsakes the tomb
Don't try to succeed without Christ as your friend
Behold the Rock, the smitten rock
Down by the river where eternal waters flow
When I was lost in deepest shame
Traveling in the glory road, leading me too the souls abode
The road to glory seems so long
O sometimes the shadows are deep
The rocks and hills speak
'Tis a mighty rocky road we travel
The rosy-fingered dawn appears
The rosy morn has robed the sky
Some happy morning bright and fair, I'm going to ride in the air
The royal banners forward go
From the heights of Calv'ry's mountain
I am on my way to Canaan's land
See where the living waters glide
With my whole heart I will praise you, O Lord
Another six days work is done
The Sabbath of the Lord
Jesus, Teacher, Lord and Master
The sacred institution, Lord
The sacred ties of friendship
Have mercy on me O God in your great goodness
I'm walking in the safest path
The ways of the world may tempt you
God guards the good with watchful eyes
The saffron tints appear
[The Sails Were Spilling Wind]
The saints appear to tread the courts
Sure God will say, My children stay
The saints in Christ are one in ev'ry place
The saints of God! their conflict past
Almighty God, appear and save!
The saints who toiled from place to place
Jesus is the same sweet Savior ev'ry day
The sands of time are sinking
I see a myriad saved
The Savior abides in my heart
As you tread life's way through the toilsome day
The Savior calls for you today
The Savior calls, ye nations hear
The Savior comes; O happiest sound
The Savior died on Calvary
Upon the cross the Savior died
The Savior in Gethsemane
The Savior is coming; the hour is at hand
O praise the mighty King of kings
The Savior is risen, light bursts from the tomb
The Savior is risen for you and for me
The Savior is waiting to enter your heart
The Savior lives, no more to die
The Savior loves us, his heart is tender
The Savior meets his flock today
Tho' oft tempest-toss'd, when all seems to be lost
As I travel on my way, I'll keep singing ev'ry day
The Savior stands knocking at the door of your heart
I have heard the voice of the blessed Christ
He died on the cross for me
I have found, I have found the way
The Savior will come, resplendent in joy
Tho' I am but a little child
The Savior's hand is knocking
There is a balm for ev'ry woe and care
Do you hear them ever sounding sweet and clear
Upon the cross the Savior died
Savior, I do feel Thy merit
The Savior's precious blood
As the sunlight breaks through the clouds o'er head
The Saviour is bending above thee
My Shepherd is the Lord Who knows my needs
There is a Love that never changes
Let not your heart be troubled
[The Scantest Touch of Grace Can Heal]
The scattered clouds are fled at last
The scene arround me disappears
The scheming elders challenged Christ
The screams of police-car sirens
The scythe had swept the meadow carpet clean
The sea is His; He made its blue expanse
I had sought throughout creation
This season calls us to return
Great God of my salvation 
The seasons are fixed by wisdom divine
When Jesus stood upon the shore
Seek the Lord while he wills to be found
Lo! a Hand amidst the darkness
Long ago, within a castle
This child was born to men of God
How I love to steal away, just as twilight dims the day
I've found a secret place of comfort and release
Alone with God, my Father, in the secret place of prayer
When we go alone at evening
The sending, Lord, springs from thy yearning heart
[The Servant]
Brother, let me be your servant
The servants of Jehovah's will
[The Servants of the Living Lord]
Servants of Christ the Lord, awake! arise
Father, forgive them
Brother in Christ! thy heart prepare
My heart! the seven words hear now
In the shadow of his wings
The shadows lengthen, Lord, with me abide
The shadows of the evening hours
[The Sheep Stood Stunned in Sudden Light]
In the fold were the ninety and nine
[The Shepherd of Love]
I was wandering, sad and weary
The Shepherds amazed the Angels behold
The voice of the Shepherd is calling
Far, far away from the Shepherdâ€™s care
The shepherds heard a voice
The shepherds heard the angel's voice
Let us go to Bethlehem, to Bethlehem
The shepherds went their hasty way
[The Shepherds Were Not Waiting]
Take the shield of faith, my brother
In the battle here with sin
I am so happy now, since the Lord came in
There is a light that shineth, 'Tis shining bright and clear
On the Christian's path a shining light appears
The shining of the earliest star
The ship of the King is sailing
Brother if you want to live in glory yonder where the sun will not go down
Far from the east we come
I cannot master time and space
When at last I cross the silent river
There's a lovely land beyond the silent river
The silent stars shine down on us
The sinful earth was sunk in woe
Oft we blend our voices in songs of love
The sinless one to Jordan came
The sinner that truly believes
Come all you've spent your blooming days
Alas! for I have seen the Lord
The sinners how blest who pardon receive!
As on the cross the Savior hung
When gracious Lord, when shall it be
Ah Lord! ah Lord! what have I done
My sins and faults of youth
No matter how lonely and gloomy the day
The sky tells the glory of God
The clouds of sin are drifting low, beneath this gloom
O happy soul how fast you go
The Small Catechism
The smallest of my brothers
On shining brook and boundless sea
The smoke alas, must still ascend
Have you heard the sobbing of a thousand million souls
There are millions now in darkness marching downward t'ward the grave
The soldier keeps his wakeful watch
The soldiers led the Savior out
We are soldiers ev'ry one
The solemn feast was spent
The Son forsook the Father's home
The son of Consolation!
The Son of David bowed to die
The Son of God goes forth to war
The Son of God his glory hides
The Son of God is come to save
The Son of God proclaim
The Son of God, so high, so great
The Song of God, through his Spirit and Word
The Son of Man goes forth today
The Son of Man has been revealed
"The Son of Man must suffer many things"
The Son of Man shall come
[The Son of Man Will Be Betrayed]
Sing to me Christian the songs I love
Deep in my heart keeps ringing
The song is faith: our wonder now professing
I have a song my heart is singing
Let Heaven, and Earth, unite, to pay
Earth has detained me prisoner long
The Lamb is worthy that was slain; Riches, and power to him belong
Blessed are the poor in spirit
My soule doth magnifie the Lord
Praise ye the Lord, who hath avenged
The dawn of morning veils her face
My days I said are now cut off
I said, in cutting off my days
Wondrous joy, Thy joy, Lord Jesus
I to the LORD in my distress
In my heart ringing, joy to me bringing
My soul, to magnify the Lord
[The Song of Moses]
I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted
I'll sing the triumphs of the Lord
I will sing, I will sing to the Lord
O LORD, Almighty GOD! thy works
We praise thee God, we knowledge thee
Lord, you now have set your servant free
Now Lord, as thou hast said, dismiss
O Lord because my hearts desire
With my own eyes I have seen the salvation
LORD, let me now depart in peace
Let HIm with kisses of his mouth
The Lamb is worthy that was slain
My soul doth magnify the Lord
My soul doth magnify the LORD
I have a letter from my Lord
Thou worthy art to take the book And open every seal
Thou Lord, the Glory, Honour, Pow'r
O Holy! holy! holy LORD!
O Holy, holy, holy, Lord
All glory to the most high God
[The Song of the Lamb]
O HALLELUJAH! honour, pow'r
Haste away to harvest for the fields are white
O ruler of the universe, Lord God
Fairest of ten tousand, Is Jesus Christ my Saviour
The time was early evening
My soul doth magnify The Lord, who reigns on high
The LORD, the GOD of Israel
The onely Lord of Israel
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
Blessed are you O Lord our God
The Lord, the God of Israel
There is a song within my heart
I can face all trials here
Awake, my drowsy soul, awake
You saints of light that shine so bright
The soul that's filled with virtue's light
The soul who truly God believeth
There is a land where shines the light
I have given my heart to Jesus
Jesus is the soul's unending Friend
[The Sound of Joyful Shouting]
Hark! how the Gospel trumpet blows
Lo the fields all white for harvest stands
Listen to the surf, listen to the surf
The source of hope is in the Word
In his own appointed hour
[The Sower]
[The Sower]
A farmer went out to plant the seed
Ye sons of earth prepare the plough
A sower was wending his homeward way
[The Sower Scatters Seeds]
The spacious earth, and what the earth contains
The spacious firmament on high
The spacious firmament, that hangs on high
The Spacious heavens declare
The spacious heavens laud
The spacious heavens tell
[The Spirit and the Bride]
O harken, sinner, to the voice
The Spirit binds us to our Lord
The Spirit breathes upon the Word
[The Spirit, Brooding]
The Spirit called on Philip
The Spirit came as promised
Have you heard the voice of angels
The Spirit intercedes for us
People are gatherin', the church is born
The spirit moved the people to the promised land
[The Spirit is Willing]
[The Spirit Led By Day]
The Spirit lives to set us free
Called to proclaim the good news of Christ to the poor
The Spirit of God sends me forth
O, the Spirit of Jesus is in this place
[The Spirit of Power]
[The Spirit of the Lord]
The Spirit of the Lord fills the world
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
The Spirit of the Lord
The Spirit of the Lord our God
The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon you
The Spirit of the sov'reign Lord
They told me she was lost to me
The Spirit sends us forth to serve
How am I held a prisoner now
The spirits of Washington, Warren, Montgomery
You stood before creation
Long years ago on a deep winter night
A star appeared, and peaceful threw
Will that bright star again appear
Amazing grace how sweet the sound, there's glory in my soul
The star of morn has risen
The star proclaims the King is here
The stars declare his glory
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
The Lord is my portion, says my soul
O God of all the broken
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
Though dark be the night and long be the day
The sting of death is sin
The stone which the builders rejected
The storm came to Honduras, to Nicaraguan towns
Courage, my soul, and let us journey on
The storm is strong; we face the wind
My soul is singing glory, since Jesus set me free
There's a message free and grand, ringing over sea and land
The sweetest story told on earth
Oh, the Bible tells the story how the Saviour left His glory
'Tis a marvelous story how the Saviour from glory
Our Savior came to this earth one day, the debt of every soul to pay
How wondrous the story of infinite love
Above the sweetest songs of earth
Go preach the word till all have heard
It was the very noon of night: the stars above the fold
There's a story, oft repeated
Let me hear it told again
I heard an old, old story
O list to the story that never grows old
I'm glad I found my Savior
There's a stream flowing in peace
There's a stream of mercy deep and wide
There is a land where life is true
The strife is o'er, the battle done
The strong and gentle voice
Jesus, believing we rejoice
Why dost thou stand afar
Let Thy summer gift, O Lord
The summer is over, now endeth my race
To that summer land up yonder
I am walking day by day
The sun arises now
The Sun arose in clouds of fire
The sun clear-shining after showers
The sun declines o'er land and sea
The sun has gone down
The sun has now risen in heavenly glory
The sun has reached his western goal
The sun is on the land and sea
The sun is rising in the east
The Sun is rising o'er the world
My soul is mounting the upward way
The sun is sinking
The sun is sinking fast
The sun no more our star by day
The sun now shines in all its splendor
Sun of Righteousness, arise, Chase the slumbers from our eyes!
Lo, the Sun of righteousness
[The Sun, Unswerving]
[The Sun Was Bright that Easter Dawn]
[The Sun Went Down on Jacob's Grief]
Just after the night of death, the sun will surely arise
Whatever life may bring you is tempered by His love
Dear pilgrim as you travel on life's journey
Though thorns are overspreading the path we are treading
O ye whose hearts are longing
The sunbeams, infinitely small
I am walking in the sunlight, in the sunlight of His love
The sunny way that leads to glory
The sun's last beam of light is gone
Traveling in the upward way to that land of perfect day
With merry hearts and gay
The sunshine of a Saviour's love
Just carry the sunshine of grace
There is peace that passeth knowledge, there is hope that conquers fear
There's a mighty railroad leading all along the way of life
This is the bread of God
There is only one foundation, we should build our hopes upon
By faith we see beyond the bar
There's a very sweet song in the depths of my soul
There's a very sweet old story that I heard long, long ago
When your heart is sad and weary, burdened down with sordid care
Glory within is welling, that's why I'm gladly telling
Jesus, You're the sweetest name of all
I've heard them sing He paid the price
I love to sing of the love of Jesus
O word, of words the sweetest!
The sweetness of a thousand tongues
What wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan
The Lord said to Gideon: Go forward!
Twelve thousand stand on Gilead
What man soever he be that
The House of Bread rejoices
The table's set, Lord, your people gathered
The tables spread my soul there spies
Arise, ye men of war
Satan the tares is sowing
[The Teacher Told of Three]
The tempest is howling the storm winds are drear
The temple rang with golden coins
My soul, recall with reverent wonder
[The Ten Commandments]
God spake these words and said
Ere that solemn hour of doom
The tender love a father has
The tender mercies of our Lord
Do you need someone to guide you
I can see a band of soldiers
A day for solemn trial
The sun won't always brightly shine along your path of life
O King of Grief! how strange and true
Others may sing of treasures of earth
The thing my God doth hate
Since I'm bound for my home in the skies
My weary soul was sad and low
Think, my friend, how many souls around us look for sunlight in your life and mine
Arise, shine, for your light has come
[The Thirsty Cry for Water, Lord]
This thirsty fields drink in the rain
The thoughtless brute his master knows
I backward look to Calvary
This is the threefold truth on which our faith depends
Oh, speed far away on the ocean of joy
The time by Heaven foretold is come
The time draws nigh when you and I
The time for praying won't be long
The time is drawing near
The time is drawing near it may not tarry long
The time is now upon us
The time is soon coming
The time is swiftly rolling on
The time must come when we must part
Arise, arise and come, for lo, the winter now is past
The time shall surely come
This is the day, this is the day the Lord hath made
The tiny child to Bethlehem came
'Tis a solemn thought to think
We shall lay aside the burdens that our hearts have had to bear
[The Tomb is Empty!]
O ye who linger
The tongue, the tongue, with all its powers
Once my life was lone and sad, and no peace nor joy I had
There's a hand reaching down when the night-shades enfold
I come to a beautiful highway
At evening in the gloaming
In memory there lives a spot which time has touched in vain
I'm standing, standing at the station
We hear the tread of royal footsteps marching on
The tree of life with ev'ry good
There's a Tree in heaven's garden where the weary find sweet rest
The trees full of sap
You shall go out with joy 
A believer, free from care
The trespass of the wicked man
The true and joyful Sun is He (Er ist die rechte Freudensonn)
All we who have known the Law's dreadful sentence
The true good Shepherd God's own son
[The True Shepherd]
The trumpet calls to triumph, a glorious vict'ry waits
O the weary world is trudging
Hear ye the mighty trumpet sound
O conq'ring host, your leader calls
The trumpet sounds the day has come
The trumpet sounds the day is come
The trumpets sound, the angels sing
First among the Christian graces
Once a woman silent stood
To man, it seemed that evil had prevailed
There is a way, a narrow way
There is a way that leads unto God
O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
Established in the highest heav'ns
The universe was waiting
The day wears on to eventide
Though unseen, O Lord, I love Thee
[The Unseen King is Served]
Hold up hands, loving bands
The unutterable Word thou art
[The Unveiling]
When God spake unto Noah, and told him to build the ark
There's a world above this lowland
We're on the upward trail
Beneath our best we may not live
We shall meet, but we shall miss him
In the beautiful vale of contentment
When I think of how the Savior died for me
Oft in death's shadowy vale, like screen of night
The valley of vision is dusty and dry
Such a long, long time ago In a land so far away
Why are you marching along to war?
Praise the Lord, the strife is over and the fight of faith is done
Saved by grace, O let us sing the victorâ€™s song
Lo! Yon bright, countless throng
Christ lives again to rescue men
Hear the battle cry that's ringing over all the earth
March on,M march on, ye soldiers of the cross
Thro' the land a call is sounding
[The Victory of Our God Is Won]
I'm over in Canaan where riches abound
When life's trials are over, its battles all won
This war is ended, the peace table laid
The victory's won
The vineyard of the Lord Before his laborers lies
In corners and down in the shadow
The virgin Mary had a baby boy
The virtue of humility
[The Vision of the Living God]
I heard a voice, â€˜twas low and sweet
The voice from the bush said: Moses, look snappy
There's a valley where the mocking birds are singing
The voice of Christ our Savior
The voice of free grace Cries 
Brother heed the call, holy Spirit call
The voice of God is calling
I have heard Thy voice, dear Savior
When I hear the voice of strangers
I was wand'ring thro' the lonesome valley
The night was dark, and all was still
The voice that breathed o'er Eden
Lo, I see a hill and upward climbs One, weak and faint
How glorious is God's greatness!
A prize is set before us
I am standing outside thy door tonight
[The Walls of Hate Are Broken]
[The Walls Will Come Down]
The evening bells were ringing
There's a promise divine in the Bible for you
I stood where the ripened grain unrolled
The watchmen blow the trumpet round
O the joy, tell it out
How much of joy and comfort
I know the way I go
'Tis a bright and pleasant path where with Christ we roam
There is happiness in my soul, since the Savior has made me whole
There is a path that leads to God (Baxter)
There's a highway, holy highway, to heaven above
I've found the way of life eternal, and I sing as on I go
There's a way of deep remorse o'er sins committed
The pathway of Thy Passion
Were you there when the judge condemned my Lord?
I'm walking the way that leads to glory
Jesus left the glory of the heavens
I am the Way, the Savior said, The paths of sin forsake
You may keep on working till your life is over
The way to heed God's holy call
Jesus, the Son, who came to save us
I wandered far from home, condemned to endless woe
The wealth of high estate
Up the weary road to Calv'ry
Come all ye weary travellers
The weaver's shuttle swiftly flies
The wedding guests were waiting
Once sorrowed by tears, our eyes are now bright:
The weight of death bears heavily
The Christian's home in glory
"I'm going away," said the boy to his father
Life is a journey; long is the road
Oh this well of living water
Good people all, this Christmas time
Go forth, go forth to the whitened fields
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord
The whole bright world rejoices now
The whole creation sings thy praise
The whole wide world for Jesus This shall our watchword be
The whole wide world for Jesus
The wicked Fools must sure suppose
The wicked fools must sure suppose, That God is but a name (Tatke and Brady)
[The Wilderness and Desert Shout]
Thou sweet, beloved will of God
The will of God is always best
The will of God is always best, His will be done forever
[The Will of God To Mark My Way]
I saw, when the winds swept over the mead
The wily Judas watches near
The wind that brake the rocks, and rent
The windows of heaven are open
When a mighty storm came sweeping
The winds that career o'er the bosom of ocean
The winged herald of the day
There is a haven safe and sure
I am happy in Jesus each hour of the day
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins
The wise man built his house upon the rock
The wise may bring their learning
The wise men saw a light afar 
They that be wise shall shine as the skies
I've a story sweet to tell
The heavens in their splendor declare
The woman hiding in the crowd
There's the wonder of sunset at evening
[The Wonder of Salvation]
O the wonder of the story
When I survey the wondrous cross
Full of wonder, full of art
I've found a Friend, the best of all
How still was the night while the shepherds were dreaming
I have heard a sweet story of love full and free
O sweet is the story of Jesus
O wonderful, wonderful story Believers so love to repeat
There's a story comes from Glory
A wonderful story we sang to the world
Jesus came my soul to save, for my sins His life He gave
We are on our homeward journey
Listen to the wondrous gospel story
O how wondrous is the story, How the matchless Son of God
[The Word]
Leaving heaven's glory
Christ dwells in our hearts through faith
The Word made flesh has dwelt among us
Savior descend with pow'r divine
The glorious Gospel of the Son of God
The Bible is the written word of God
The word of God rings harsh and clear
The word of God a promise told
The Word of God became flesh
The word that God has given, why should a man deny
The Word of God, the Word of truth
[The Word of God Was from the Start]
The Word of God's our heritage
In a byre near Bethlehem
The Word of our Lord
O the book of the ages no power can overthrow
The Word, the uncreated Son
[The Word Went Fishing By the Sea]
The Word whom earth and sea and sky 
The work is Thine we undertake
The work is Thine, O Christ, our Lord
Each day we sing of Christ our King
O Thou who dwellest in the sky
The works of the Lord are created in wisdom
The world abound with God's free grace
The world did dwell in dark and fear
The world for God! The world for God
The world, the world for Jesus
Beloved of Jesus, go forth and God speed thee!
The world He made He still sustains
The world in condemnation lay
Jesus said to his disciples
The world is full of stories
The world is in a sorry state
The world is needing us
The world is sad with hopes that die
The world is very evil
The world itself keeps Wesak day
The world looks very beautiful
The world may boast the brilliant light
We shall leave this land of sorrow
One day when the sons of Zebedee
The world was in darkness in sin and shame
The world was lost in darkness
The world, who know not God
All men on earth that live
The Savior's love is wonderful
O wondrous world within a world
The world's great need is Jesus
Hark! all the world is singing
The worth of truth no tongue can tell
Attend my people and give ear
Hark Israel and what I say
The year is gone beyond recall
The year now hastens to its end
Come, welcome this new year of grace
The time is swiftly moving
The years of time are rolling on
The yellow, red and blue shall fly
Help me, O Lord, thy yoke
O the yoke of Jesus is but light
O! why do the little stars wink, wink, wink?
While I am blest with youthful bloom 
Thee, God, we praise, Thy name we bless
Thee, in the watches of the night
Thee, Lord, I love with sacred awe
Thee, Lord, my strength, I'll dearly love
Thee, O God, we humbly praise
Thee, O Immanuel, we praise
Thee, prostrate I adore, the Diety that lies
Thee, thee we praise, O God! and own
Thee we adore, eternal Lord!
Thee we adore, O hidden Savior, Thee
Thee, we adore, O Savior, God most true
Thee we praise, high priest and victim
Thee we praise, our God and Father
Thee will I love, my God and King
Thee will I love, my Lord, my God
Thee will I love, my Strength, my Tower
Thee will I love, my Strength, my Tower
Thee will I love, my Strength, my Treasure, My heart in Thee finds peace and joy (Glahn)
Thee will I love, my strength, my Treasure, My heart in thee
Thee will I praise with all my heart
Thee, with the holy self-sprung Fount, we sing
A happy song today is ringing
Them over there do not have names
Once my heart was fill'd with sorrow
O be careful where you step
Old Glory, we love thee, our emblem so true
If human hearts are often tender
Then I have conquered; then at last
Then I saw a new heaven and earth
Then let us attend
Then let us glory in the cross
Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord
O wondrous God, when I  thy world consider
Then the glory Then the rest
Then, then the Gospel day shall rise
Then, then thâ€™intestine war is oâ€™er
Our Captain is leading, the foe must retreat
Now is the precious seedtime
There are lights by the shore of that country
There are many ways of sharing, But God's Spirit gives each one
There are no strangers to God's love
There are times I want to stop
There are two commands recorded in the Bible
There are two ways in this, our day
I will try to be a soldier of the cross
There came a little Child to earth
There came a message from the sky
There comes a galley laden
There comes a galley laden, A heavenly freight on board
There comes to my heart one sweet strain
There for me the Saviour stands
There has never been a friend like the Lord
There in God's garden stands the Tree of Wisdom
Sometimes I feel discouraged
There is a blessed home
There is a book who runs may read
There is a City with streets of gold
There is a crown awaiting
There is a dwelling place above
There is a fountain filled with blood
There is a friend, a precious friend
There is a Friend, a faithful Friend, whose tender heart can feel
There is a game that hormones play
There is a little gardener
There is a God, all Nature cries
There is a God that reigns above
There is a green hill far away
There is a happy land
There's a land of fadeless beauty yonder in the starry sky
There is a land of fadeless beauty
There is a land of pleasure
There is a light that shines afar Upon the narrow way
There is a Light, that cheers my way
There is a line of women
[There Is a Louder Shout to Come]
There is a mighty question we ask when nations rage
There is a name, a holy name
There is a name so beautiful that you may speak today
There is a need for shepherds
There is a new heaven; there is a new earth
When I was lost, you came and rescued me
Thereâ€™s a time for remembering
There is a Redeemer
[There is a Redeemer] (Peacock)
There is a rest for the faithful and pure
What shall we fear
There is a river pure and bright
There is a Rule of Thumb
There is a safe and secret place
There is a sea which day by day 
There is a spot of consecrated ground
[There is a Table Where Pharisees Gather]
There is a time that we must rise
There is a time for ev'rything
There is a time wherein to tell
There is a way, a narrow way, That leads us to life's endless day
There's a way up to life, and a way down to earth
"There is a way that seemeth right"
There is a world we have not seen
There is an empty box that some would throw away
There is beauty and grace all around
There is beyond the sky
Where shall we find bread in the wilderness?
There is but one who knows my need
When the Savior came to dwell below
There is cleansing in the fount of Jesus' precious blood
How well I remember that glorious day
Since the loving Saviour cleansed my heart from sin
I am happy on my way to the glory land
Naught to me is earthly fame
Are you in darkness, oppressed by the night?
On that lonely hill, there is pardon still
There is joy among the angels
There is joy, great joy, we are told
There is joy among the angels
There is joy down in my soul
In the love of Christ, your Savior
There is joy today, for the lost one is found
There is perfect joy in singing
[There Is Joy in the Lord]
I will sing hallelujah, for there's joy in the Lord,
There is joy in the service of the Master,
There is mercy in Jesus, there's mercy in Jesus
Is there something missing? Is there more to life?
There is need of love light, every passing day
There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ
There is no darkness where Thou art
There is no friend like Jesus
There is no friend like Jesus
"There is no God," so saith the fool
There is no greater portrait
There is no name so sweet on earth
I love to sing of Christ my King
Do you need a friend indeed
There's a home in heaven where the crowns are given
There is no sorrow, Lord, too light
There is none holy as the Lord
There is none like You
A guilty soul, by Pharisees of old
When I saw that I was lost in darkness I began to pray
There is not in my heart left one treasure, dear Lord
I was once lost in sin
There is nothing told about this woman
There is one Body and one Spirit
There's a house of many mansions
[There Is One God!]
Bear with one another in love and charity
We were called to be one in the Spirit of God
As the dew from heaven falls upon the earth
There is one way, and only one
There is peace in the name of Jesus
There's a fountain of blood
There is power in the name of Jesus
Are you tired of sin and sorrow?
Tho' the journey be long and our hearts lose their song
'Tis a wonderful story I'm telling
There is so much to discover
There is something wrong if we cheer along
There is springtime in my soul today
There is sunshine today Gleaming over my way
Once I was just a wayward sinner
There are angels arrayed in white
"There remaineth a rest to the people of God" When this life with its labor is done (Chisholm)
Beneath the Cross of Jesus kneeling
Our morning sun now out of mind
There still is room, His house is not yet filled
There then to Thee Thine own I leave
Come, poor pilgrim, sad and weary
There upon the cross of Calvary
There was a child in Galilee
[There was a man named John the Baptist (Island of Kauai)]
There was a Romish lady
[There Was Jesus By the Water]
[There Was Naaman the Leper]
Bells are going to ring in praise of Jesus
There we sat down, and wept, by streams
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
There were twelve disciples Jesus called to help him:
There where the judges gather
Thru the Valley of shadows
[Therefore, I Urge You Brothers]
[Therefore, My Dear Brothers, Stand Firm]
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return
Therefore we, before him bending
Therefore we lift our hearts in praise
There'll be a great rejoicing in heaven some sweet day
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
Many here are lonely, longing day by day
There is a land where we'll nevermore die
ONE golden dawning, one glorious morning
There'll be shouting in glory when we get home
There's a day now fast approaching, the most wonderful day of all
There will be triumphant singing in that sinless summerland
I am on my way to the land of day
There will come a day of gladness, by and by
There'll come a day when sorrows will have vanished
Child of My Love, why dost thou falter?
When windbags say that violence is the way
I have laid my burden down Where the crimson waters flow
There's a bright side somewhere
When the Savior came and found me, distressed was I and lost
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul
There's a fold, both safe and happy
There's a friend above all others, O, how he loves!
There's a Friend for little children
Thereâ€™s a Friend in the homeland far away
There's a garden whose walk we never have known
Why do you wonder which way to go?
There's a gladness in my heart today
Each day the sun comes out to shine, the stars and moon, they leave on time
We've sung about the love of God
As I travel on my journey toward the setting of the sun
There's a hand that's ever writing
There's a home beyond the stars in the palace of the King
There is a place that's prepared for me just over the rolling tide
I have had a bright vision of heaven so fair
When by life's troubles and cares I'm opprest
Thereâ€™s a beautiful city far away
Thereâ€™s a light upon the mountains, and the day is at the spring
There's a little white cabin beyond the blue sky
I've a longing today of a home far away
Camp meeting in the wilderness
Since the Savior pardoned all my sin
There's a new song in my heart
Our boat is launched upon the sea
There's a place where the streets shine
There's a Promised land where our feet shall stand
There's a quiet understanding
Once a sinner from Christ I was wand'ring away
Forty days and nights afloat
There's a rainbow shining somewhere
Do you ask me why I am happy
There's a reason why I am singing and rejoicing today
There's a promise of love in the rainbow above
There's a river of life that's flowing from His throne
There's a road between our lands
Rejoice, ye sons of men! Your brightest praises yield
There's a seed in a flower
There's a song of *love in my heart;
There's a song for all the children
Jesus saved me from the miry pit of sin and shame
There's a happy song that's ringing in my heart each passing day
There's a song in the air
There's a song in the heart of creation
I have a song within my heart
There's a sound on the wind like a victory song
There's a spirit in the air
There's a spirit of love in this place
There's a star in the East on Christmas morn
There's a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place
Though thy life be torn and broken
There's a voice in the wilderness crying
There's a way back to God from the dark paths of sin
There's a wideness in God's mercy
There's a wonderful day that is not far away
We meet with many liars while trav'ling here below
There's claim number one, and claim number two
All along the way we sing
When the ransomed millions leave this old world of care
I have never found another friend like Jesus
Come, all ye broken hearted
There's more than one way to see what we see
Since I have found my Savior,
The angel choir is singing
There's no greater name than Jesus
It does not really matter how big or small we might be
There's no night there, there's no night there
There's no one like Jesus can cheer me today
There's no one like my Savior
There's no one to turn to like Jesus
I was sunk in depths of sin and shame
There's not an echo round me
Among those mansions over there
There's only One who understands
There's only one flag for me
There's only one way for us to have peace
There's only one wayâ€”one way to heaven
There's peace that passes telling
My happy soul rejoices 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! There's just something about that name
I'm following Jesus my wonderful King
There's within my heart a melody
Take my heart, O Lord, take my hopes and dreams
These are the facts as we have received them
These are the holy Ten Commands
These are the jewels all glorious that shine
These Emmets, how little they are in our eyes!
These forty days of Lent, O Lord
These things did Thomas count as real
These things shall be! A loftier race
These three are the treasures
These treasured children present now
March along together, firm and true
I was gloomy and sad
I have loved ones whoâ€™ve gone to
They asked, "Who's my neighbor and whom should I love..."
They brought Him to the hill of death
They built the church that is our home
They came a milling crowd
They came with faith to seek the Lord
The men who crucified Jesus
[They Cast Their Net into the Sky]
They cast their nets in Galilee
They come from the east and west, they come from the lands afar
They come, God's messengers of love
They cried, "Let Him be crucified!"
Come, sinner, behold what Jesus hath done
They crucified my Lord
They crucified my Savior
Our blessed Lord was crucified
They crucified the Savior
[They Devoted Themselves]
They Did Not Build in Vain
They disbelieved for joy
[They Have No Wine]
They laid him in the tomb
They leave the land of gems and gold
They, like to Sion's sacred mount
They part my garments among them
They sang a song, a happy song
[They Set Out on Their Homeward Road]
They shall come from the east
They shall come from the east, they shall come from the west
They shall not pass my consciousness, these tho'ts of grim despair
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or stand in God's holy place?
How unspeakable is the wonderful pow'r
High in yonder heavenly courts the ransomed sing
They that be wise shall shine, They that be wise shall shine
Though it seems that your prayers have been in vain
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy
They that traffic on the sea
They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength
They that wait upon the Lord
They walked with God in peace and love
They who confess the Savior here
They who hear my words
They whose course on earth is o'er
[They'll Know We Are Christians By Our Love]
God's happy pilgrims shout and sing
They'll waft for us sooner o'er
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone, my sins are gone
We miss good friends and loved ones too
My daddy has gone to that city above
Cleanse me, dear Lord, from ev'ry stain of sin
Thine arm, O Lord, of old
Thine be the glory, God of Light
Thine eye, Lord God, alone can see
Thine for ever! God of love
Thine honor save, O Christ, our Lord
Thine is the glory
To thee we lift our voices
Thine is the kingdom, O Lord Christ
Thine is the Kingdom of goodness and mercy
Thine is the Kingdom, Lord
Thine is the power To guide us on our way
Thine the amen thine the praise alleluias angels raise
Things are diff'rent now
Things are the way they are, and not the way they're not
Thou hast shone within this soul of mine
Oh what will be the day when won at last
Think about His love, think about His goodness
Think, my brother, think, won't you stop and think, what will be your soul's true worth
Think big: an elephant
Speak gently to the erring
When the clouds are hanging over thee
Think of Jesus, in the morning
Think on me, Lord, for Thou art kind
When in the shadow no star can be seen
Soul whither bound?
Jesus saves and He will keep
Some wonderful day, a home far away
As I travel life's highway, I keep singing a song
We read of a home where pure waters gleam
When I see those hated trees, with the thorns among the leaves
It helps when temptation sweeps over my soul
Hear, O Lord, the sound of my calling
This be our prayer, O Saviour of our souls
The flowers and birds are Thine, O God
This blessÃ¨d night we seek Your throne
This blessed word be mine
Christ was made one in our flesh
This body in the grave we lay
On Passover our Lord preparÃ¨d to
This Child secretly comes in the night
This child we dedicate to Thee
A parade began at Calvary
Give us this day our daily bread
This day a child is born
This day at thy creating word
This day in answer to God's call
Saints of God come and lead you to the holy city
This day is holy to the Lord
This day new light will shine on the earth
This day the first of days was made
This day the light of heavenly birth
This day the Lord has spoken
This day, this day, I know I'll find a way
You opened the gates of heaven
I thank you, your love is eternal
[This Earth Belongs to God]
How soon has roll'd
This globe of earth, with all its stores
This glorious Easter festival
[This Has Been a Test]
This holy covenant was made
[This House of Yours]
Our Father Everlasting
Lord, my trust I repose in thee
This is a day, Lord
This is a day of new beginnings
This is a fence around the yard
This is a miracle-moment which God is revealing
This is a time to remember the greatness of the Lord
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
This is God's moment, God's moment for you
This is how me know
This is Jesus' precious Bible
This is my body given up for you
[This is My Body]
On your journey to the kingdom
This is my body
This is my commandment
Greater love has no one than this
This is my country, Land of my birth
Breaking bread with friends
This is my Father's world
Heavenly Father, this is my prayer
[This Is My Son]
This is my song, O God of all the nations
Though bitter the blast of the storm may be
This is my story, this is my song
This is my will, my one command
Great is the myst'ry we profess!
God, Creator, free us from sin
Peace I give you, peace I leave
From heaven you came, helpless babe
This is our prayer
This is the chosen day of God
This is the day
[This is the day]
Christ has conquered death at last
This is the day the Lord hath made
O sacred Pasch of which we joyfully sing
Sing, O sing all the earth
This is the day that the Lord has made
This is the day of light
This is the day of rest
This is the day of the Lord
O tell the Lord how thankful you are
Give thanks for the Lord is good
This is the day the Lord has made
This is the day the Lord has made
This is the day the Lord hath made
This is the day the Lord hath made
This is the day the Lord hath made, A day most holy to his name
This is the day when Christ arose
This is the day when Christ arose
This is the day when light was first created
This is the day which the Lord hath made
This is the day which the Lord hath us given
This is the fast, which I will choose
This is the Fast, which I will choose
This is the feast day of the Lord's true witness
Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain
This is the good news which we received
This is the hour of banquet and of song
[This Is the Joyful Celebration]
[This Is the Mind-set of One Who Has Come]
This is the mystery, that Christ has chosen you and me
This is the night, dear friends, the night for weeping
This is the Spirit's entry now
[This Is the Story]
O live by the word from the mouth of God
This is the truth we hold
There is a way, a bright and shining way
This is the year when hearts go free
This is what our Saviour said
Shall I tell you why I ceased from folly?
This is your coronation
Meekness and majesty, manhood and Deity
Lo! now is the accepted time!
And the kid and the leopard shall play
Have you a burden on your soul
This joyful Eastertide
This Life's a dream, an empty show
This little Babe so few days old
This little light of mine
This is our church, we study without cease
This night, O Lord, we bless Thee
This night, while I am sleeping
[This One Thing I Do]
The prize of the heavenly calling
This one thing I know
This sacred space has called us
This solemn Feast our joyful songs inspire
This spacious globe of earth
This stone to Thee in faith we lay
This, this is the God we adore
This Touch of Love
His trial o'er, and now beneath
[This vision of peace]
This we can do for justice and for peace
This we proclaim about the Word of life
This wide, wide world for Jesus
Once there came to earth the Savior of the lost
They tell us that Jesus once died on the tree
This world for Jesus, yes, our world for Jesus!
[This World Has Great Rewards to Give]
I've left the land of death and sin
Torn by conflict and commotion that now fills the hearts of men
This world, my God, is held within your hand
In this world of sin and sorrow we are often brought
This world's not all a fleeting show
Tho' oft, O Lord, we've felt thy heavy wrath
O, enter then the Temple, when
When we're free from carnal might again
Those eternal bowers
THOSE first disciples of the Lord
Those golden gates are op'ning wide
Those hating Zion have afflicted me
When life upon this earth for me shall end
O ye who have wandered away from the Lord
Those who are holy, loved of God
[Those Who Have Trusted in the Lord God]
Those who love and those who labor
Follow Jesus all the way
Those who place on God reliance in despair
Those who rely on the Lord are unshakeable
Those who see light can walk in the dark
Those who seek your face, Lord
Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength
Thou all sufficient one
Thou are gone to the graveâ€”but we will not deplore thee
[Thou Art a Shield for Me]
Thou art able, blessed Jesus
Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth
Thou art but man, to thee 'tis known
Thou art coming, O my Savior
Thou art drifting down life's river
Thou art gone up on high
Thou art merciful, O Father
Thou art my blest portion, thou dear Nazarene
By all whom thou hast made
Thou art my Friend, O Saviour dear
Thou art my God and I will praise Thee
Thou art my God, O God of grace
Thou art my hiding-place, O Lord
Thou art my Hope, O Christ my Lord
Thou art my portion, Lord
Thou art my strength, O God my Lord
Thou art, O Christ, the Way
Thou art passing away
Thou art the Christ, O Lord
Thou art with me! Tho' far from friends and home
Thou art worthy, Great Jehovah
Thou awful God, whose righteous ire
Thou burning Love, thou holy Flame
Thou, by heav'nly hosts adored
Thou canst o'ercome this heart of mine
Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb
Thou dear Redeemer, I am Thine
When Thou didst with pitying eye
Thou didst toil my soul to gain
Thou dost not pass a lonesome way
Thou dost reign on high with a kingly crown
Thou fairest Child divine
Thou Father of all blessings
Thou Father of the fatherless
Thou, Fount of blessing, we adore!
Thou from the cradle to the grave
Thou from whom all being sprang
Thou glorious God, before whose face
Thou God, all glory, honor, power
Thou, God, art a consuming fire
Thou God that answerest by fire
Thou gracious Power, whose mercy lends
Thou great instructor, lest I stray
Thou great, mysterious God unknown
Thou Hallowed Chosen Morn of Praise

In the dark of the midnight
Prayer to a heart of lowly love
"Till he come"! O let the words
Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow
I want to be a faithful worker, each day
I wandered after pleasure away from home
In the house of many mansions, With its portals bright and fair
Tossed upon life's stormy ocean where the angry billows roll
When the way is drear, bringing sorrow and fear
I have everlasting joy that nothing ever can destroy
Dear Savior, thro' the far-spent night
Bright till our Lord's returning
Till we gather again, God be with you
May His peace be with you till we meet again
God of sleep, and God of slumber
Time flies, Man dies
Time for celebration!
Time grows not old with length of years
Time is fleeting fast away
Time now to gather
We're young just once and we then grow old
Time to pray, time to say
[Timeless Love! We Sing the Story]
Windows of heaven are open today
As each moment passes by
Tip, tip, tap, the woodstick's tapping
Tiptoe softly up the stairs
Tired with the greatness of my way
In drear darkness and danger I wandered
'Tis a pleasant thing to see
"â€™Tis all too late," the sinner cries
This world is full of care
A little while, earth's fightings will be over
There's a hillside stained crimson
â€™Tis Christmas morn! with noiseless tread
'Tis dawn: to God I lift my hand
'Tis done! Thou dost this moment save
Though I see not what's before me, doubts and fears make pathways dim
'Tis finished all, our souls to win
'Tis finished! the Messiah dies
'Tis finished, 'tis done! The spirit is fled
"Tis folly all" let me no more be told
'Tis for conquering kings to gain
There's a pardon full and sweet
'Tis from the mercy of our God

'Tis good, Lord, to be here!
Labor on today with a courage strong
I heard God's voice commanding, "Go up, the land possess"
'Tis good to thank the Lord
'Tis good to wait upon the Lord
â€™Tis He! â€™Tis He! The Son of God!
When the sun shines bright and my heart is light
Amid the busy throng of life
'Tis Jesus calls my soul away
Tis Jesus in the morning hour
'Tis madness they shout (though their findings are sound)
The Savior has come in His mighty pow'r
'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow
'Tis mother's day, O restful
'Tis my happiness below
â€™Tis natureâ€™s voice which reason speaks
Tis not enough for me to simply start
'Tis not of him who weeps and prays
'Tis patience must support you
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
'Tis sure, that awful time will come
'Tis sweet to sit with the Master
O 'tis sweet to talk of Jesus
â€™Tis Thanksgiving morn again!
Tis the blessed hour of prayer,
'Tis the Day of Resurrection
â€™Tis the fair dawn of heavâ€™nly day
'Tis the gift to be simple
'Tis the Lord thus far hath brought me
It has landed many a thousand
'Tis the same old story of the Saviour's love
'Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain
Oppressed with noonday's scorching heat
'Tis winter now, the fallen snow
'Tis wonderful how the Lord, of all
'Tis wonderful to know the joy that cometh from above
How wretched was our former state

To a place of celebration
To a virgin meek and mild
To Adam thus Jehovah spake

Enough to nature and to grief is paid

I am trav'ling onward to a country
I was a stranger to the Saviour wandering hopelessly along
Trav'ling, trav'ling over the world
Tread thou the path of rectitude
Tread ye the path of right and bravely forward go
Evensong is hushed in silence
I am now made heir to riches in glory
We are taught in Bible story not to lay up treasures here
Tree of Life and awesome myst'ry
We remember we are mortal
I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree
Trees don't want to be mountains, they just praise the Lord
Peace, bringing it all to peace
Tremble, O tremble!
Tremendous Lord of earth, and skies
Tremendous Lord, Thy voice we hear
Cast thy burdens on the Lord, Leave them with thy Savior
The souls that would to Jesus press
Tried is every faithful man
Dark is the world, my brother
Rejoice, ye saints, the time draws near, When Christ will in the clouds appear (Anonymous)
Triple beam of glory
Now the salvation and strength and the reign and the might
Riding on comes the King of the lowly
Come, angels, seize your harps of gold
Triumphant from the grave
Triumphant Sion, lift thy head
Rejoice, give praise, our King is here
When with Powers of heaven attending
When Christ the Lord shall come
What Saviour comes from Edom
Then the earth in terror shook
Word of God, Who by Thy will
From the calm of sleep awaking
O Jesus, when our spirits mourn
Trotting, trotting through Jerusalem
True conscious honor is to feel no sin
True faith needs no defence
Many strive to lay up treasure
I am so glad since Jesus came
True God and yet a Man?
How happy is the Christian's state
Celestial content, inexhaustible treasure
True happiness is love expressed in service
[True Light Blazing in the Darkest Place]
I'll be true, Lord, to Thee
I am not concerned to know
True Shepherd, who in love most deep
There's a true story about a man in a boat
The world is rich in human lore
True hearted, wholehearted, faithful and loyal
Truest Friend, who canst not fail
Truest lover of thy people
Truly God is good to Israel
Truly, my soul doth wait on God
Trumpet of God, sound high
Trumpet the Name! Praise be to our LORD!
The way may be thorn-lined and painful to tread
When the shadows fast are creeping
The Lord almighty is my light
Trust and trembleâ€”that is all
There's many a trouble would burst like a bubble
I would trust Him in the shadow
If you would ever do your very best
Jesus made each star in heaven
Sing, sing, sing your cares away
From the earth with time's probation
When we hear the tempter's voice within
Does the way look dark before thee?
Trust in God and march to glory
When the path is dreary and the skies are gray
Trust in God and you will be
Why, O my heart, these anxious cares
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Trust in the Lord
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart
Sinner, wouldst thou be saved
Sing when the day is bright
Trust in the Lord for He is most high
Trust in the Lord at all times
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Trust in the Savior and be not dismayed
Trust in the strength of Jesus
Trust on, is not the Saviour at Thy side
Trust only in Him who alone can save and keep you
In this world of sin and sorrow
O trust thyself to Jesus When conscious of thy sin
Blest be the Lord, my rock, my might
Trusting in Thee, Lord
Happy in Jesus my dear Lord, singing His praise in true accord
Jesus is with me, cheering my soul
My Savior shed his blood for me
I am trusting in the promises As recorded in God's word
Trusting in Christ to send us
I will trust in the Lord, for His love will endure
Indulgent still to my request
Trusting in Jesus, my loving Savior
Trusting in Jesus throâ€™ weal or throâ€™ woe
Lonely paths I traveled, and I had wandered from the field
Like faithful Noah in the grand old ark
Sure that this true Friend needed aid will send
I have found repose for my weary soul
Rock of ages, still the same
Trusting is believing that God will keep His Word
Simply trusting ev'ry day
Trusting now in Jesus I can rest secure
Trusting, only trusting every passing day
Trusting thee ever, doubting thee never
Trusting you, trusting me
We are toiling through the darkness, but our eyes behold the light
Downhearted and discouraged
You have tried the path of worldly pleasure
You may have tried this world's way
Come unto Jesus, all ye that labor
Try my heart, Lord, search and know it
Try to carry sunshine
Lord, I'm bearin' heavy burdens
[Tui Amoris Ignem]
Tune in on Heaven, hear God's radio
While Jesus is broadcasting salvation full and free
A will so yielded, give me, Lord
In vision the prophet Isaiah
Jesus, let thy pitying eye
Turn back, O man, forswear thy foolish ways
Turn it over to Jesus
From all that leads to death
Jesus came from heav'n above
Still there are many who stumble in sin
Turn our hearts to you, O God
[Turn our Hearts to One Another]
I am God, who comforts you
Turn to me, Lord, and have mercy
For now is the time of fulfillment
Turn to the Lord and seek salvation
Turn to the Lord in your need
As panting in the sultry beam
Turn, turn, unhappy souls, return
Turn us again, O God of hosts
O turn ye, O turn ye, for why will ye die
Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways
O soul, are you weary and troubled
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Turned by Thy grace, I look within
O believer, now rejoice
T'wards a world that has no guns
Twas a beautiful morning, when Jesus I found
'Twas his own love that made him bleed
All the prophets foretold in ancient early ages
Far out on the mountains, away from the fold
'Twas mother's love, and mother's prayers
'Twas my purpose, on a day
I dreamed I went back to that little old shack
Twas only a missing sheep
'Twas the eternal word that spake
Christ the Lord reached down from the cruel cross
'Twas the suffering of Jesus
[Twelve Names!  And Names Are Nearly All]
[Twelve Years Were Near an End One Day]
Twere you that pull'd the vengeance down
The day is goneâ€”my soul looks on
This old world is filled with sadness for ev'ry one below
Pray on, pray on, O weary not
When I cross the great divide, pass the waters' chilly tide
When I get to heaven some morning
'Twill be so wonderful there
O weary heart bowed down with care
I'm on my way to glory land
Twin princes of the courts of heaven
Twinkle, twinkle little light
Two are better far than one
[Two Brothers Come to Blows]
[Two By Two]
We are sent two by two
Two fisherman, who lived along
Two little blackbirds sat on a hill
[Two Little Fishes]
Two useful little friends have I
[Two Men Came to God in Prayer]
Two nations side by side
Two noble saints both rooted
Two people came to church to pray
Two sails flashing bright on the royal-blue bay
Two Thousand Years Since Bethlehem
[Two Travelers Left Jerusalem]
Two were bound for Emmaus, disheartened and lost
Twofold, Father! is my pray'r
We gather together in the love of Christ
Laut erschallet Glockenklang
Oh Uganda! May God uphold thee
Ultimately we may not have free will
All you that love the Lord draw near
Unbounded Spirit, breath of God
Unchangeable all-perfect Lord
Unclean, unclean, and full of sin
Unconscious bias, it poisons all of us
Under His wings I am safely abiding
Covered with feathers of mercy
In God I have found a retreat
Under the arches of the night
I have found a precious resting place
We are soldiers of the cross, counting not earth's gain as loss
Under the blood of God's own precious Son
Under the care of my God,Almighty
Under the spreading chestnut tree
Father of mercies! God most high
Oh, what a refuge I have found
Under the stars, one holy night
Full often as I meditate
Ah! lovely innocence, how evil art thou deem'd
Under Thy wings, my God, I rest
We love our countryâ€™s starry flag
Undismayed whatever fortune
Unexpected and mysterious
Unfold, unfold, unfold ye portals everlasting
For years I had drifted, Godâ€™s plan could not see
Unfurl the banner, let it wave
Unfurl the Temperance Banner, And fling it to the brezze
Unidos, unidos, en tu nombre unidos (Together, together in your name we gather)
Attend, ye saints, and hear me tell
Union of faith, and hope, and love
Grace of the Father before there was time
Unite and join your cheerful songs
Let strife forever cease
Behold how good and how pleasant it is
Many times we disagree
For all the church: may it be Christ's compassion
If we have died with him
In his own body, by his own wounds
[Unless a Grain of Wheat Dies]
Jesus Christ, lifted up
Unless the Lord shall build the house
We are a people whose life comes from you
Unless the Lord constructs the house
Unless the Lord the house shall build
I use a spoon to eat my soup
[Unless This Day Be Holy]
O the unsearchable riches of Christ!
Unseen God, your hand has guided
Unsettled world, where people long 
Heaven thundered
I cried, yes, I cried
Lord, I prayed and I prayed, prayed all night long
Until Jesus comes
Let that day come, O Lord
We're waiting for the Savior till He comes
My heart can sing when I pause to remembe
O for the joy that daily calls me
Unto Caesar let us render
Unto Christ who loved us
Unto God our Savior
As I travel along I am singing a song
Unto my Lord Jehovah said
Unto my words, O Lord give ear
Unto the hills around do I lift up
Unto the hills I lift mine eyes
Unto the hills I lift mine eyes
Unto the hills I lift my eyes
Unto the hills I lift my eyes
Unto the Lord lift thankful voices
Unto Thee my heart is sighing
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul
Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul
Unto Thee, O Lord Jehovah
I will cling to the cross every hour
Unto thine altar Lord
Unto Thy church, Thy body, Lord
Unto us a boy is born
Unto us a Child is born
Unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given
Alleluia, Alleluia
O shepherds tell us
Jesus came down to this world of woe
I am unworthy of the price He paid for me
Up from the depths I cry to God
Up from the earth, and surging  like a wave
["Up!" God Says to Jonah]
Up in heaven, up in heaven
Up in the sky
Up rose the morn behind the hills
O'er the earth the storm-clouds gather
Up in that land above the sky
Up through endless ranks of angels
Up to Jerusalem my Lord goes to die
Up to the mountain went the Lord
Up to the temple one fine day
Up to you I lift my eyes
Up to your table, Lord, you call us
Up, up, my heart, with gladness
Up, up, my soul, on wings of praise
Up, up, my soul! with gladness rise
Up, yes, upward to thy gladness
Upheld by hope - a glorious hope
The shades of night were falling fast
Upon Judeaâ€™s midnight plains
[Upon the Bad and Good]
Upon the cross down lying
Upon the cross extended
Upon the hills the wind is bleak and cold
Sometimes I am lonely, sometimes I am blue
Upon the rock of faith, The church has firmly stood
Upon the sixth day of the week
Upon Thine altar, Lord, I lay
Upon thy table, Lord, we place
[Upon Your Holy Mountain]
Shadows may often come to darken the way
The call "come up higher," is ringing out still
Yonder over the valleys low
Upward where the stars are burning
[Use Me]
For Thee, dear Lord, a cross I'll bear
Use me, O my gracious Savior
When it seems your trials are so hard to bear
Use your hands for Jesus
How long wilt thou forget me Lord?
Vain, delusive world, adieu
Vain foolish men profanely boast
Vain the bliss from earth that springs
Vain world, now farewell
Sweet vale of Eden, soul-rest forever
Valentines! 
For all the souls who sought thy way, O Lord
Valiant soldiers we will be
Forward, ye children of the King
Come, Holy Spirit, come, Show us our way
Honey though the bee prepares
Wealth is a blessing only lent
Various the objects man desires
Eternity! no mortal knows
Vast the immensity, mirror of majesty
Vast throngs in the stark wilderness
This is the wood of the cross
Come Holy Ghost eternall God
Veni Sancte Spiritus
Holy Spirit, Lord of Light
O come and let us now rejoyce
Incline thine eares unto my words
Oh, what a Savior, that He died for me!
Lord, open my lips
Softly the shadows darken
On the wings of light declining
The shadows of evening draw nigh
[Victors in Christ]
Raise the standard of the Lord on high
Hallelujah, what a thought -
Out of the stillness, solemn and deep
Vict'ry all the way along
Clad in all the armor of the King of kings
Hail, Jesus, You're my King
Victory comes only after battle
I heard an old, old story
Soldiers of King Jesus, raise the shout again
Harken, brothers, harken!
Sound the note of victory
Victory is mine
Victory is on our lips and in our lives
Sound the news o'er the world
All along on the road to the soul's blessed refuge
O ye redeemed of the Lord, rejoice
My Savior has promised me Vict'ry some day
With the blessed promise of our Father
Jesus died on lonely Calvary
There's a deep settled peace abiding in my soul
Fighting the battle for the King, close to His side I'll ever cling
I beheld water, which proceeded out of the temple
View the present through the promise
Viewed only by the feeble rays
Soldier, go! Thy vow is spoken
On thy journey to the homeland
Vile wretch I am!
Vindicate me, O God, my God
A new commandment I give you
And everyone beneath the vine and fig tree
Virgin-born, we bow before thee
Virgin, full of grace, purest of our race
Virgin mother, oh, rejoice!
My burdens I'm patiently bearing
Last night I saw in my dreaming
Visions of Vict'ry now burst on my sight
Vital spark of heav'nly flame
Dear Savior! we are thine
Before the Lord God with my voice
I with my voice to God do cry
O Lord, you bless us each day
Voice of making, calling cosmos
Friends have departed from earth below
Voices raised to You we offer
Voices that challenge
Vouchsafe, O Lord, Thy presence now
We may plant some blossoms
See that host all dressed in white
John was a-preachin' by the shores of Jordan stream
Wafting Him Up on High
You turned my wailing into dancing
O troubled heart, there is a home
Prepare the way for the Lord
Often the darkness surrounds you with gloom
Wait, my soul, upon him
Wait, my soul upon the Lord
Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will
Wait on God and trust him
Wait on the Lord
Wait on the Lord, our strength renewing
Wait on the Lord when you are weak
Are you weary in the conflict
Iâ€™ll wait to be honored above
For they that wait upon the lord
I am waiting for the master
I have many friends over yonder
I am waiting by the river For the message to come o'er
I will meet you by the river, waiting for the guide
Friends and dear loved ones have gone on before
My lamp is burning and cheerful its glow
I am waiting now for my Lord to call
I am truly looking for my blessed Lord, soon He's coming back again
Amid earth's toil and weariness
I'm waiting for the dawning of a better day
Waiting, waiting for the boat to take me o'er the foam
I am waiting for the morning
I've trudged along the rocky road of life for many years
We are waiting for the Savior
Through this lonely world of sorrow we have journeyed many years
Waiting for the victory to come
I am waiting for Thy coming
Does the thought ever come to you, brother
Waiting in silence, waiting in hope
Only waiting till the shadows
In this world we're waiting, our ship will come
Oft in dreams I hear voices sweet and clear
Is thy heart oppressed and weary
Wake, all ye soaring throng, and sing
Wake, awake, for night is flying
Wake, awake the night is ending!
Wake, awake, for night is flying
Wake, awake, for night is flying
Wake, awake, for night is flying
Wake, awake to duty!
Wake, awake, ye Christian people
Wake, brothers, wake the dawn is now appearing
Wake from your sleep, a Savior is born
Wake, harp of Sion, wake again
Wake, Isles of the South! your redemption is near
Let me walk the straight narrow way
Wake, my soul, with all things living
Wake, O wake, and sleep no longer
Wake, O wake! with tidings thrilling
Wake the song of Jubilee
Wake, wake, wake! Flowers cease from dreaming
Wake to the songs that lips unsullied sing
Wake up and rise from death
Sin is all around us as we travel life's road
Your saving Lord is near. Wake up!
Once you were darkness, but now you are light
Wake, wake, I pray thee, shrill-toned lyre!
[Waken, O Sleeper]
Waken, O sleeper, wake and rise
The land of my fathers, the land of my choice
Blessed Jesus walk beside me
[Walk in Love]
Look, look, look by His light we're led
Is the lamp of Jesus' word
Over the world a glad message now rings
Walk in the light of the heavenly way
In days to come the desert shall bloom
I want to walk, walk like Jesus
Walk together children, don't you get weary
Let us live by the Spirit 
Jesus is the Light for all
When Moses heard the call of God
Walk with me, Oh Lord, I pray
O dear Lord! walk with me
Walk with me, walk with me
In the highway that leads to the city of rest
Christ the Savior bids you journey with Him
Walk worthy of the Lord
When the lowly Jesus trod the paths of men below
Walking and talking with Jesus, I'll walk with Him all along life's way
Two pilgrims walked along a weary road
Walking and talking with Jesus my Lord
In my heart there is a song
You are our God, and we your people
On the final day I shall fly away
Walking in a garden
Walking in the Savior's footsteps
Walking in love, on my journey I go
Walking in someone's shoes
I'm walking in the gospel way
Walking in the light
Walking in the light, Walking day by day
Walking with Jesus in His lovelight
I can feel the spirit now, as to Thee I humbly bow
Walking in the promises, the Word of God
[Walking in the Spirit]
In the sunlight of God's precious love eternal
In the bright shining way I am walking today
I am walking ev'ry day, in the bright and shining way
Walking in the blessed way called beautiful, and I'm happy each day
While walking in the way with Jesus
Jesus taught the people, taught them by the shore
I am trusting in the Lord and relying on His word
Walking on the winged wind
Walking, gladly walking on the way
I shall ne'er forget the day when My Lord came down
The sun is shining brightly, onward I go
Canaan I am bound to see
How could I hope to cross life's plain
Out upon Galilee one night
My way gets brighter, my load gets lighter
I am walking with my Savior
[Walking Up to Jesus]
I am singing a song as I travel along
Happy the journey along the narrow way
Walking with God, walking with God
Down in the valley of despair and darkness I wandered
I am walking each day along the bright way
Walking with Jesus, O how delightful
My days are swiftly passing by
Walking with Jesus the beautiful way
I am walking with Jesus on the highway of life
Wonderful joy and gladness I find, since I left worldly pleasure behind
Walking with Jesus day by day
I walk with my Savior each step of the way
I have s Saviour who is precious to me
I am happy as on I go
I'm walking with my Savior today along the blessed glory-land
I am walking with my Savior to the glory land
I am never sad and lonely
Once I was lost, a slave to my sin, lonely was I, no comfort within
Hallelujah, I'm walking with the King
Peace and love abide within, when our souls are saved from sin
Trusting in the Saviour, trusting Him each day
Wanted, wanted, loyal hearts are wanted
Warm as the sun, fresh as the breeze
When the wind of winter blows
Warned of that vindictive day
Sinners, now wand'ring in darkness
To the flaming field of battle! We are marching to war
O wondrous love that every one may know
Was it enough, that God should die
Was it for me
Was it for me, for me alone
Was it for me, the nails, the spear
Was it for sin, for mortal guilt
Was it in vain that Jesus died
Someone loved the lost and dying
Wash me and cleanse me
Wash me clean in that cool river
Wash me, cleanse me
Wash me through the grace of God renewed within
Saviour above
Wash, O God, our sons and daughters
Have mercy, gentle God
From Jesus' lips we hear the call
Did Christ, the lovely Son of God
Watch and pray, Watch and pray, Will you watch and will you pray
The Master has left us the warning
O my brother, trust in Jesus, watch and pray
Brother are you ever watching for the coming King?
In the morning, in the evening
Watch and wait unafraid
Watch, my soul, and pray
From a season of light
Watch once more the windswept storm clouds
As you go along thru life's busy throng
Watch with Me, the Master said
Watchers, let your lights be burning
Watching, all through the weary night
Tho' the way be cheerless
We are watching for the dawning
Watchman from the height beholding
Watchman on the walls of Zion, Tell, O tell, us of the night
Watchman, tell us of the night
We who are Church are vessels of clay
Water, blood, and Spirit crying
Water flowing, flowing free
Water flowing from the mountains
Water has held us
Who are like the lilies white
A woman of Samaria came to where the well of Jacob lies
All you who thirst, come to the waters
Water, River, Spirit, Grace
Before I can remember
Cleansed from all sin, baptized you are reborn
Waters of love, God's power now declare
Wave, wave your banners high
A glorious blessing bestowed upon me 
Waving in the autumn breeze
We read about a time when the people of God were carried away
Happy land, morning land
Way, way, way
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
We acclaim the cross of Jesus
For the mighty moving of thy Spirit
We adore you. Lord, we love you
We all are now one people
We all are one in mission
We all believe in God who made
We all believe in One true God
We all believe in One true God
We all believe in one true God
We all believe in one true God, Maker of the earth and heaven (Janzow)
You have called us out of darkness

Coming, coming, we are coming 
We have heard thy gentle voice, O blessed Savior
We are coming, Lord, to the table
We have harken'd to Thy tender invitation

We build with mortar, brick, and wood
We built up a house that was stately and strong

[We Glory in the Cross]
We glory in the cross, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

How sweet is the name of our Savior
We hail the rising Day Star - the lamp within our heart
We hail thee, Lord, thy church's Rock
We have a dream: this nation will arise
We have a gospel that matches the hour
We have a gospel to proclaim
[We Have a Great High Priest]
Have we any hope within us
We have a King who rides a donkey
We have a sure prophetic Word
We are a new creation
I am the vine, you are the branches
We have caught the vision splendid
We have come at Christ's own bidding
We have come to sing Your praises, Lord
We have gathered, Jesus, dear
We have gathered to hear of a Savior
We have heard a joyful sound
We have heard the joyful news
We have heard the wondrous story

We march, we march to victory!
[We Marvel at Your Mighty Deeds]
When we view the golden sunset
We may choose to walk through this world alone
We may spread our couch with roses
We mean "Will you love me?" whatever we say
We Meet as Friends at Table
[We Meet Together In the Name]
We meet upon this lonely shore
We meet You, O Christ, in many a guise
Hear the terms that never vary
Life is filled with longing
God of justice, Saviour to all
The fields are white, the harvest will soon be past
We must work while it is day
We need a faith so colorblind
O how we need a miracle so all of the world would believe
These are the days of tribulation in this weary troubled land
We need your pow'rful hand, dear Lord
We needs must die, who banished lie
We now arise, the light is come
We now implore God the Holy Ghost
We now show forth the dying of our Lord
We now with gladness tell
We offer Christ to you
We offer Christ to all the world around us
We offer our gift and ourselves to Thee
We, only we believe indeed
Let us serve the Master each moment here

The Bible is the book divine
We thank You, Lord, for Your gift to us
We rejoice to be God's chosen
Here, a million wounded souls
We remember his death
More than ear can hear
As we drink this cup, we worship You
We remember you
We remember you, our Yesu
"We rest on thee" - our shield and our defender
We rise to praise Thee now, dear Lord
We sang our glad hosannas
We saw Thee not when Thou didst come
We see the eyes of Mary shine
We see the Lord
We will see our home in heaven
Here we can't find a city of refuge
Here we have our trials and crosses, of the day seems long and drear
There will be a blissful morning when the earthly night has flown
We shall gather in the morning when our race on earth is run
In a little while when trials are ended and for us the vict'ry is won
After our sorrows, our troubles and cares
Often here we wonder why we have so many trials
We're singing today of mansions of gold
There is a place of joy and gladness in the home above
There is a land of fadeless beauty waiting ahead
There's a place, now our own, that is vacant and lone
This life on earth will soon be o'er
Often here we're forced to part with those we love
I have loved ones who have gone to the City up above
We shall meet beyond the river
We shall soon cross the river and homeward we'll go
A mighty King is coming soon
We shall meet our friends departed
We've lost a precious loved one
We shall not give up the fight
[We Shall Overcome]
We shall overcome
[We Shall Prepare]
O never be weary, with vigor pursue
Death is not a valley dark that we should fear
O what rejoicing with the Savior, my King
Come to me, all you weary
On that glory hallelujah morning
We are absent here from the Lord we love
The burdens of the world grow heavy
Hail, thou coming King of glory
We shall see him in the morning when we cross o'er the river
Here we wander in doubt and fear
Though the way we journey may be often drear
Jesus went a heav'nly mansion to prepare
What a jubilee 'twill be up yonder when we gather on that shore
With our Saviour we can safely onward go
Out beyond the shadows dim, in the new Jerusalem
Lord, You have chosen me for fruitfulness
We shall stay awake and pray at all times
Sometime the veil of life will rise
Here we do not understand, as we travel thru this land
We shall meet those Christians there
There will be no sorrow there
We shall wear robes of white, in that land of delight
Christ, the Redeemer, left heaven's bright throne
When we love as he has loved
Sing the song of triumph, of Savior crucified
We sing for all the unsung saints
We sing His love, who once was slain
We sing, Immanuel, Thy praise
[We Sing of an Unfailing Love]
We sing of God, the mighty source
We sing of loyal Lydia
We sing of the saints filled with Spirit and grace

We thank God for giving us life
We thank God for the harvest
We thank Thee for the morning light

We thy people praise thee, praise thee
Jehovah leads and all is well
Day by day we travel on in the light of love divine
We trust the mighty love of God
[We Turn our Eyes to Heaven]
We turn to Christ alone
We turn to thee, O Lord, and sing
We turn to you, O God of every nation
We utter our cry: that peace may prevail
We wait for the eternal light
O Son of God, we wait for Thee
By childlike faith in Christ the Lord
We come to join together
We walk by faith and not by sight
In times of trouble walk with us
We walk today in darkness,
Here together we walk, every day, every day
I'm going to glory, My home in the sky
We walk with faith and passion
We wander singing through the land
We sing our Maker's matchless praise
We want to banish all things
We want to be like Jesus
We want to learn of Jesus and His church on earth today
We want to see Jesus lifted high
[We watch for you, O Lord, till break of day]
We welcome you to the table of our Lord
We went as you told us
We were baptized in Christ Jesus
[We Were Not There That Glorious Day]
We who live by sound and symbol
[We Who Live in Christ Were Born in His Death]
We who once were dead
[We Will Be Together]
Jesus Christ, our loving Master
We will carol joyfully
Jesus, we will come to Thee, every day, every day
Do not fear, for I am with you
We will dwell on Calv'ry's mountain
We will exalt you, our God the King
We will extol you, ever-blessed Lord
We will extol your praise, our God and king
The bugle call is sounding o'er the world today
Tho' the storm may frown above and the winds dash high
When the world and sin oppose
We will gather sheaves for Jesus
Children are the lambs of Jesus
We will glorify the King of kings
We will go in the strength of the Lord
We will go out with joy in the Spirit
Let us seek with our minds the truth of Christ
When the cares of this life are all over, and we reach that good land above
We will not close our wakeful eyes
We will overcome thro' the blood of the Lamb
[We Will Pray As Jesus Taught]
We will rest, sweetly rest, by and by
O come bless the Lord all you who serve the Lord (Hay)
Like a shepherd I will feed you
Wealth can be an idol
Hands quick to welcome, hearts to embrace
There's a happy time acoming and we know it won't be long
In this sinful old world there are heartaches and pain
We will sing of our Redeemer, He's our King
You're my brother, you're my sister
We will take what you offer
Here this world is filled with trouble as we go along our way
The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. By still waters he leadeth
We will walk with God, my brothers
Let us work and wait, let us watch and pray
We will work for Jesus and adore the plan
We wish you many happy returns of the day
We wonder why the leaves must fall
We won't leave here like we came, in Jesus' name
We worship and adore you
We worship, Lord, before Thee now
We worship you, O God of might
We worship you, our Father who created
We would a fire kindle
We would be building, temples still undone
We would see Jesus; lo! his star is shining
We would see Jesus, Jesus alone
We would see Jesus; for the shadows lengthen
We yearn, O Christ, for wholeness
We Your people bow before You
Bugle calls are ringing out
When the days are dark and dreary, and the clouds are hanging low
Weary now, I seek repose
Weary of all trumpeting
Weary of self, and laden with my sin
Weary of wandering from my God
Weary soldiers of the cross, seek rest
Weave, weave, weave us together
We are many textures
[Weep for Eve, the Earth's First Mother]
Weep, little children, weep
There'll be no night in the New Jerusalem
Weep no more this holy morning
Weep no more, Zion, dry thy streaming tears
Weep not for Him who onward bears
Weep not for the saint that ascends
Behold, he weeps over Jerusalem
Weeping sore, the Mother stood
Weeps the Savior oâ€™er His foe
Sinner, awake from thy sleep of sin
Let's walk together for a while
Welcome, child of Mary
Welcome, Christmas, welcome here
Welcome, delightful morn
Welcome God's and Mary's Son
Welcome, happy morning!
Welcome here, new year of grace
[Welcome Home]
I am longing today for my home far away
Welcome home, O wandering child
Often times I'm sad and blue
Welcome home, precious child. Come, reclaim your place
Welcome into this place
Welcome, Jesus, you are welcome
You rule the nations
I'll dress up in my best
Welcome, welcome, Sabbath morning
There's a welcome here, a welcome here
Welcome the bright millennial day
Welcome the hope of Isr'el's race
Open your heart to the Spiritâ€™s entreating
[Welcome the Wild One]
Welcome Thou victor in the strife
O when shall I sweep through the gates
Welcome to my Father's house
Tears are falling, hearts are breaking
Welcome to the family of God, Welcome, all the praise will go to Him
Light the candles, bring your presents
Welcome to this feast of witness
Welcome, Welcome, ev'ry guest
Welcome, welcome, O Redeemer
Children are welcome, Christ said one day
We'll all be gone tomorrow
Here we often meet together, stay the whole day long
Well art thou leading, Guide supreme
I am thinking just now of my home far away
For we'll be dwelling together
[We'll Be Faithful]
We'll be going home when the morning, breaking, brings the glad eternal day
In the kingdom of God's glory, where the skies are always fair
When our pilgrim journey's over, and we reach that lovely land
When our labor shall end we shall homeward ascend
When our days on earth are ended
When this life on earth is ended and we lay our burdens down
Once I dreamed that I was singing in the old time country church
I love to think of my heavenly home
Praise Him! praise Him!
We'll shout and sing our Redeemer's praise,
When our Lord shall come again He'll banish all our fears
Well done! good and faithful servant
As I go winding my way to glory land, the home of the soul
Out where the banner of Jesus leads
Well for him who all things losing
Sometimes when sorrow overcomes us and the darkness hovers low
On the resurrection morning, when the dear Lord shall call
As we labor here amid the disappointing scenes of life
What a vision it will be
A happy home awaits in glory
Won't that be a happy morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
When God dips his pen of love in my heart
A man can kill with a knife of steel
There once was a man as mean as could be
If your world's caving in around you
We're crossing life's sea with Jesus
We'll keep the old flag flying
When we leave this world of sin and shame
To our friends and loved ones here we say goodbye
Our Saviour came from heav'n above
Dear friends and kindred gathered here
When the dear Lord shall come again to this old world of sin and pain
Fare thee well, our friend and brother
Just beyond the gloomy shadows that surround us here below
In the Bible we read of a city
We'll never let the old flag fall
We'll praise the Lord for sins forgiven
O let us be careful while sowing our seed
When we've run the race with patience in this sinful world below
Jesus, our Redeemer, from the heavens is coming again
Our Lord is coming, coming on some morning fair
So oft I dream of heaven
When we reach Heaven, sweet home land given
When I reach my home in Glory land I'll shine, shine, shine
When our stay on earth is ended and we meet in heav'n above
Weâ€™ll sing a new song
We meet to praise the King of glory
Some day where all is well with angels we shall dwell
We'll sing in the morning the songs of salvation
The birds are singing in the vale
What a happy day that's coming by and by
There's a home of peace and happiness waiting
Never worry tho rough the road
Some of these days I'm going home where no sorrows ever come
We shall not always walk this way
We love the Red, White and Blue
When we get home some morning bright
Many times we must wonder just why we must bear
God has given us a message for the nations
We'll to God's tabernacles go
I'm often made to wonder along this pilgrim way
We are tossed and driven on the restless sea of time
In this world we have our trials, sorrows great on every hand
We will all wake up some morning
We'll walk in the light, beautiful light
Weâ€™ll walk the land with hearts on fire
When we have pass'd this vale of tears
This world is a battle field
We'll work and sing for Christ our King
We're a youthful Christian band
Wellspring of Wisdom, hear our cry
We're a bright light together
We're a happy band on the march to Canaan's land
We're a happy band going to that land
We are marching hand in hand
We're all seeking the same Saviour
O weary one, on time's rough sea
We're certainly sure
When we've filled our mission here, and homeward we shall go
We're enlisted in the army of the Lord of hosts
One day I met an old fashioned mother
We're glad that we belong to you
We're glad we're saved by grace alone
Working time will soon be over, and our pilgrimage will cease
Pilgrims and strangers o'er earth now we stray
GOD'S soldier marches as to war
There's a city of light where our loved ones are gath'ring
We're growing, getting big and strong
With Satan's hosts about us
Battles now are raging wherever we may go
We're marching on, we're marching on
A joyful song we'll sing today
We're not alone when ants are marching in a line
We're not at our best when living in fear
We are marching up the hillside
We're on the homeward trail
We've answered to the battle cry to conquer over sin
We're parents of a soldier whether knowing it or not
Life's ebbing tide appears before us like a restless sea
Soldiers we, with armor brightly shining
[Were They Old Friends That Jesus Called]
We're throwing out the Life-Line
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there, were you there on that Christmas night
We've a story to tell to the nations
We've been singing, we've been singing
We've been told a joyful thing
I've been in the valley and I prayed night and day
Don't be discouraged with trouble in your life
We've come this far by faith
Just remember the good things God has done
Thou art holy, Thou art mighty
We've got a great big wonderful God
Christians, we have met for service
You were the Word at the beginning
Did you ever think what the world would be
Praise him, we've come to praise him
I am filled with new delight
What a time of great rejoicing for the redeemed ones by and by
What a day of great rejoicing, in the happy by and by
When the shadows dim are past and we gather home at last
Waiting and watching for our Savior for He will come to earth again
There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come 
Jesus is coming back to this old earth again
He lifted my burden of sorrow and sin,
When at last we stand on the golden strand
What a fellowship, what a joy divine
What a friend is Jesus! One so precious can you find?
What a friend is my Redeemer
What a friend we have in Jesus
On that bright and glorious morning
At the sounding of the trumpet, when the saints are gathered home
When this pilgrimage is over and we reach that shining shore
When the toils of life are ended at setting of life's sun
When my life here is ended and my soul has ascended
What a glad song I sing, Christ is my Lord and King
It is finished; what a gospel
Just a touch of His hand to my soul feels so grand
When we shall hear the call that will be made to all
When the redeemed ones all assemble on that beautiful golden shore
What a great singing that will be when we get home beyond the sea
When the last day's work is over, at the setting of the sun
One of these days our Lord is coming, coming to take His children home
I was just a lad and my heart was sad thinking I was lost for aye
There will be a grand reunion over on the other side
What a happy meeting, what a blessed greeting
O what a bright and happy morning
I am getting near my destination, nearer to my future habitation
When we reach the shining portals of the place prepared above
In my heart there is a melody, precious song of God's love
What a joy, this Habitation!
What a joy to know as we onward go toward the setting of the sun
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
Our Father's wondrous works we see
When all the clouds of darkness break
What a mournful life is mine
When the jewels of earth shall be gathered
Jesus came down from His glory and throne
What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, all our sins
Did you ever think how Jesus
I was o so lonely and so helpless
Pilgrims on the journey through the wilderness of life
What a shout was heard in the realms of light
When we all have reached the portals of the New Jerusalem
O what a singing there, on Heaven's shining shore
What a day of great rejoicing over in that land of song
Happy on the journey as I travel to that home above
What a strange and wondrous story
In this dark, lonesome world we are pilgrims today
In amazement I view the years gone by
On that morning when we shall rise
How my heart o'erflows with rapture and glory
Christ has for sin atonement made
When our travelling days are ended and we gather on heaven's shore
I have a song in my soul today
Brother, when you feel downcast and blue
What a world of sound it must have
What Adam's disobedience cost
What am I that God should call me
What are the praises earth can render heaven?
What are these in bright array
What are these wounds, so deep, so wide
In the books of the Lord the angels record
What are we doing here on planet earth?
Oh, what are you doing for Jesus?
What are you doing for Jesus
Some of these days life's clock will stop
What are you sowing, my brother
What Beauties divine
What blessedness belongs to him
[What Blessing God Bestows]
What blessings in the Lamb abound
What blest examples do I find
What boundless love did Jesus show!
My precious Lord came down from heaven's glory
What but Thy right hand of power
I have a Saviour, wondrous, strong
What can I do, I asked my Lord,
If you cannot cross the ocean, And the heathen lands explore
What can I do? What can I bring?
What can I give him, poor as I am
What Child is this, who, laid to rest
The Lord has washed away my sin, for when he knocked
What colors God has made
My path sometimes seems long and rugged
What could I do without Jesus
What dazzling glories strike mine eye
What desp'rate madness strikes the heathen? Say
[What Do You Do When a Friend Arrives, Hungry]
[What Does the Lord Our God Require]
What does the Lord require for praise and offering
What does the Lord require of you?
God has told you
What e'er ye sow that shall ye reap
What fabled names from Judah's past
What favor, Lord, that I should meet
What feast of love is offered here
What gift can we bring
What Glories surrounding my Saviour I see!
He can move the mountains
[What God Does, That Is Nobly Done]
What God ordains is always good
What God ordains is always right
What God ordains is good indeed
What God prepares for those who love him
What good can come from faith alone?
What good remains in me?
What grace is mine that He who dwells in endless light
What grace, O Lord, and beauty, shone
What had I been if Thou wert not?
What hast thou done to show thy love
What hath this wretched world to give
Death and destruction were hovering near
[What Have We to Show Our Savior]
When the Savior died to save me
What hinders your coming to Jesus
What hope! An Eden prophesied
Weary of myself, my folly and my pride
What if all the world was given unto me
Jesus is coming to earth again
[What if the One Who Shapes the Stars]
Warnings we find on the sea of life
[What If We Could Speak All the Words]
What is our God, or what his name
What is our life?
What is the crying at Jordan?
What is the pattern
What is the thing of greatest price
What is the World?
What is the world like when God's will is done?
What is the world to me
What is this bread?
What is this place where we are meeting?
What is your life, friend, vapor or cloud
What jarring natures dwell within
What joy it is to praise our God
What joy or honor could we have
What joy to reach the harbor
What kind of greatness can this be
What kind of love is this
What kind of man can live in the world where God lives?
[What king would wade through murky streams]
What law, beloved Jesu, hast Thou broken?
Though the earth was filled with sin
Jesus came from heaven, sinners to redeem
What majesty and grace
Behold, what love, what boundless love The Father hath bestowed on us (Warner)
What marvels the Lord worked for us!
What matter, what matter, if dark is the way
What means that soft, enchanting strain
What mighty pow'r the soul could feel
O lost ones, in danger no longer remain
The Savior came down from Heaven above
Soul far astray in the valley of sin
We speak of the land of the blest
What mysteries, Lord, in thee combine
[What, Never Thirst Again?]
What nobler subject can the soul employ
What noise shall we make to say that God is great?
What of the night, O watchman?
What of the night, O watchman, mark
What offering shall I bring to thee

What Shall I Render to the LORD
What shall it profit me by and by

The Lord on trial stands today
What will you do with Jesus

What is your prospect, O sinner
O what wilt thou do when thy feet are slipping
What within me and without
Sometime I shall leave for a mansion in heaven
What wonderful joy I'm having today
WHAT wondrous gifts are in my care
Come, listen while I tell the story, a story that is ever new
As I go along I will sing a song, of my Savior's wondrous love
What wondrous love is this, oh! my soul!
When the hosts redeemed to Zion come With gladness and with song
What would I do without Jesus?
What would Jesus do, dear Brother
What would you sell to gain
What you gave us for our taking

Whatever God ordains is right
Whatever is true, whatever is right
Whatever the cross may be

There is joy and gladness waiting in the happy by and by
It will not be long till we see the Lord

When he cometh, when he cometh
There is a wonderful city above
O wondrous day that's coming soon

Heav'nly Father when I'm dying
When I ask God to hear my cry
After the earthly shadows have lifted

When I can trust my all with God
When I confessed my wandering way
In my memory I recall, home, sweet home the best of all
I've heard of a beautiful City
There is a land, of which I dream
When I get up yonder to that fair home on high
There is a land of gold
When I feel the touch
I was weary and discouraged with my weight of woe
All my burdens rolled away When I felt His pow'r
I found more than I ever expected
What a great throng I shall behold, walking the streets of shining gold
When I am through with trouble and sorrow
When I get to heaven, I'll be happy singing there upon the golden shore
It helps me forget ev'ry sorrow
A wondrous tho't comes o'er me stealing, sweeter than all else to me

There's a home just over yonder, where the weary rest
When I reach that lovely isle where all the saints shall go
There's a land of song and story
Ev'ry promise that I read in the Bible I heed
When I remember the story so true
When I said the last yes to Jesus
Once I was blind to the right way of way
When I cross the tide to the other side
O the brighter, better day
Why should I be lonely when the dark clouds roll?
Tho' the dark clouds rise on the sunny skies
When I see the hanging, bleeding
When I see the salmon leap the fall
Soon I'll be going, joy overflowing
When in His beauty the King I shall see
I sing when the days are all sunny
Jesus gave me wisdom that I might see
So often bleak shadows come over my way
My heart was stained with sin
When I suffer pains and losses
When I survey life's varied scene
When I talk with Jesus
When I think about the cross
Long, long ago in a far away place

When in the quiet church I sit
When in the slippery paths of youth
When in twilight, footsore, bleeding

The beautiful clouds roll o'er the blue sky
After the toil of this life has been ended

Darkness will flee and the morning shall dawn

When Jesus died to save us

When my life-work is done, and I stand by the shore
When my love to God grows weak
I have heard the call of Jesus and am on my journey home
There's a place low at His feet
When my sorrows cover me
I shall not fear the valley that lieth ahead
When night her sable curtain spreads

When the trumpet of the great archangel in its mighty tones shall sound
When the trumpet sounds on the last great day
On the cross Christ bought my pardon

When the weary, seeking rest
Are the days of long ago far sweeter than today?

You will cry for the rocks to fall
When there is peace where praise hath been
There's a sweet, yet a sad, wondrous story

There is a home of fadeless splendor, in the Bible we are told
On some morning ere long, we will join Heaven's throng
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus

That will be heaven when we get home
Far beyond the strife of this earthly life
There is a home prepared for me
O what a blessed morning on heaven's golden shore
We are happy singing on the way
What a time of great rejoicing, when we move away
Jesus went to Heaven that we might be given
When we get up to glory, we then will settle down
When we give ourselves the privilege
Some happy morning we'll go sailing away
There's coming a happy glad tomorrow
Blessings new upon us fall
There is a land, a happy land
What a happy time is coming when we leave this world of sorrow
When we lift our pack and go
When we lose a child or parent,
All the bells of glory will be sweetly ringing
All of earth's wars and all confusion, will forever there be o'er
There's a wonderful time it is not far away
On some bright and glor'ous morning
What a song we'll raise in happy praise
I want to help scatter gladness
When the days are long and you've lost your song, and the way is dark and drear
When we must bear persistent pain
When we all reach home on the golden strand
Press along and meet each test, soon will come the day of rest
When we reach those bright mansions in glory
Bells of joy will ring
Oft-times the day seems long, our trials hard to bear
When we see our Redeemer o'er yonder in glory
Here we have our disappointments in this weary land

When wilt Thou save the people?
When words alone cannot express
When worldly trials beset their souls
When wounded sore the stricken soul
I wander'd today to the hill, Maggie
"When you are praying," Jesus said
There is one thing I know wheresoever I go
Soon shall come the dawning of the promised morn
When you get religion
On the mountain of sin you have wandered away
When you my Jesus understand
When you, Lord, walked through Sabbath fields
When you need a friend that's true, gentle, kind and loving too
At the close of the day when you kneel to pray
When you started off the universe, Lord most high
We are told that the Savior will come again
When You woke that Thursday morning
Does your life ring out for Jesus with a note of cheer

Whence appears this brilliant star
Whence can it be that those deep wonders rise
Whence Shall My Tears Begin?
Wheneâ€™er again thou sinkest
Whene'er I take my walks abroad
The cross that he gave is heavy
Would you find the feast whence joy unfailing springs?
In this world we have sickness and sorrow
Where are the dead?
Where are the Hebrew children?
Out upon life's ocean, driven far from shore
[Where Briars Grow]
Where can I flee your precence, God
Where can one look for wisdom?
Where can we find you, Lord Jesus our Master?
Where charity and love prevail
By the love of Christ we have been brought together
This, this is where children belong
Where Christ is, his Church is there
Where cross the crowded ways of life
Did you ever see a kookaburra laugh?
[Where does my help come from?]
I'm longing, dear Lord, for that haven
Where hast thou glean'd today
Sweet are the promises
Jesus is a friend of mine
I can hear my Savior calling
Where he leads me I will follow
I can hear my Savior calling
What a peace when grace abounds within!
"Where is bread?" the great crowd murmured--
[Where is death's sting]
Where is God today?
Where is my God? Does he retire
Where is my God, my joy, my hope
Oft have I heard a voice that said
Where is my wayward boy tonight?
[Where is the Glory of Our God]
Where is the holy Heav'n-born child
[Where Is the One Our God Will Choose]
[Where Is the Path that Once Was in Sight]
Where is this stupendous stranger?
Where is Thumbkin?
[Where Is Thy Refuge]
Where Jesus goes I'll gladly follow
Some happy day I'll bid this earth life adieu
Since Christ my soul from sin set free
Where Jordan cuts the wilderness
'Tis hard for us all to be smiling
WHERE lowly spirits meet
Where mists upon the mountain swirled
O the day may seem long as I travel along
I am the Way, the Truth and the Life
Where nothing dwelt but beasts of prey
Where restless crowds are thronging
Where shall I then Thy Spirit shun
Where shall my wondering soul begin
[Where Shall We Get Ready the Meal]
Where shall we sinners hide our heads
Down the swiftly flowing stream of time we now drift
Where shepherds lately knelt and kept the angel's word
There is a land not far away, Where roses bloom but ne'er decay
There's a land of glory just beyond the sea
Where Temple offerings are made
Where the appointed sacrifice
There is happiness eternal in the blessed world supernal
Thru night and thru wrong we struggle along
There's a bright and shining river where flowers bloom forever
I can see the home-lights gleaming in the city bright and fair
O come to the fountain of blessing so sweet
Let me live in touch with Jesus
Where the Lord reveals His presence
You, Ninevah, are a wicked city
When a star Is shining
Much of thought I now am giving
Not by the world can our freedom be nourshed
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
Some day when trials are past
Mother grew the sweetest roses
There's a land far beyond the hills of life
[Where the Waters of the Jordan]
Our Jesus walks where the wrecks wash in
The love of Christ has gathered us as one
Love is patient, love is kind
O Savior, Thou hast left our sphere
Many friends have passed over the river
We are gathered by the one love of Christ Jesus
Since the love of Christ has joined us in one body
Called by love to gather, by Christ's love united
[Where True Love is Dwelling]
Where true love is found with charity, God is present there
Where true love is present
[Where Two or Three]
Where two or three are gathered in my name
[Where Two or Three Are Gathered]
Where two or three are gathered in my name
Where two or three have gathered
Where wide sky rolls down
Your time is coming, friend, my time is coming too
Where wilt Thou go since night draws near
Have you ever thought how lonely and dark would be the road
Where your love and their need meet, Lord
[Where Your Treasure Is]
What do you gain from all your worry
Where'er have trod Thy sacred feet
Where'er the Patriarch pitched his tent
Wherefore do the nations rage
Wherefore dost Thou longer tarry
"Wherefore He is able"
Wherefore He now in mercy cries
Wherefore JEHOVAH standest thou
Wherefore, O Father, we thy humble servants here
Wherefore, O mighty man, dost thou
Wherefore on the Cross uplifted
Wherefore weep we over Jesus
Wherever I am, I'll praise Him
Wherever I may wander, Wherever I may be
Come, set me like a seal upon your heart
Wherever you go I shall go
Christ and his Church are but one single body
On the land, on the sea
Say the word and I will stay
Whether the Word be preached or read
The Savior and Satan, my brother
Which road are you choosing, young friends?
I see the armies gath'ring for the fray
There is a home up yonder, where I shall go some morning
While beauty and youth are in their full prime
While Cynthia sheds her borrow'd light
While ebbing nature grieves
While foes assail'd me round, I bravely said
We cannot see, nor do we know
Every day all the way, my Savior walks with me
While in sad anguish, Babylon, we sat
While in the army I remain
"While it is day" my hands must be busy
While lasts this solid globe, my God, my king
While lasts thy dread resentment! Lord, forbear
While many cry in nature's night
While Mary listened to the Lord
While nature yielding to despair
While now the daylight fills the sky
While on the verge of life I stand
While saints and angels, glorious King
While shepherds watched their flocks by night
While shepherds watched their flocks by night From dangers that surround
[While the earth remains]
There is work that we can do
In a world so full of weeping
O they tell of a city far up in the sky
While Thee I seek, protecting Power
While these commands endure
While thou permit'st me, Lord, the light t' enjoy
While through this changing world we roam
While toil and warfare urge us on our way
While trav'ling down life's weary road
[While We Are Waiting, Come]
While we pray and while we plead
While, with ceaseless course, the sun
While yet the earth midst chaos whirled
While yet the morn is breaking
Will you lift a little on a tired world's load
As you wander today from the straight, narrow way
Whilst I celestial themes pursue
Whilst I shall track the depth of love
Whilst life, great God, thou giv'st me to enjoy
Whilst shepherds, in the open field
Whilst we are marching through
When the daylight dies
Whisper a prayer in the morning
Whisper a prayer in the morning, Just at the break of day
When you are tempted by Satan and Sin
When I am weary and life seems a burden
When the sunshine beameth
Like the faint dawn of the morning
Singing along the way, happy from day to day
There's a promise older than Bethlehem's manger
O, come to the Savior, O come and be cleansed
O God, according to Thy grace Be merciful to me
Precious is the blood of the lamb!
Whither should I, Jesus, go
Who are these like stars appearing
Who are those before God's throne
[Who Are We, That Grace Should Claim Us]
Who are you who walk in sorrow
Who believes the tidings? Who
[Who Believes What We Have Heard]
Now old man Noah built the ark
Who but the Lord can make the sun to shine by day
Who came down from Heaven above?
If God be for us, If God be for us
Who can declare the day or hour
Who can forbear to sing
I've wandered in sorrow and sin
Who can measure heaven and earth
O, who can measure the love of Christ
Who can satisfy my soul like You? 
Who can say what glories lie
Who can sound the depths of sorrow
Who can the strength afford
[Who Can This Be?]
[Who Can Touch and Who Can Be Touched]
Who Christ will follow now, newborn
Who dares attempt th' Eternal Name
Who died upon the tree
Who did, who did, who did, who did, who did swallow Jonah, Jonah?
Who follows Jesus? Who will hear his teaching?
Who From the Fiery Furnace Saved the Three
Who, from the shades of gloomy night 
[Who Has a Name in Jesus' Tale?]
O the depth of the riches of God
[Who Has Known the Mind]
Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Who hath believed the tidings? Who?
The Lord that made both heaven and earth
Who hath slighted or contemned

Who in thy glorious temple, Lord, shall dwell
Who is coming on Christmas night
[Who is God Besides our Lord]
Who is he who comes in triumph?
Who is he in yonder stall
[Who Is It that This Woman Anoints]
[Who Is Like Unto Thee]
Who Is My Mother?
[Who Is My Neighbor]
"Who is my neighbor?" a lawyer asked Jesus, to test him
[Who Is My Neighbor, Lord]
Who is on the Lord's side?
Who is on the Lord's side
Who is on the Lord's side? Moses loudly cried
Touch'd with a coal from God's holy altar
Who is that comes from Edom
Who is the baby an hour or two old
Who is the king of glory?
Who is the man that shall ascend
[Who Is There Like You?]
Who is there like You
[Who Is There On This Easter Morning]
Who is this host arrayed in white
Who is this, so weak and helpless
Who is this that comes from Edom
Who is this that comes from far
Who is this who breaches borders
[Who Is Thy Neighbor]
Go ye into the world, the gospel now teach
Who knows how near my end may be?
Sometimes I lose myself in worry as I wander
Who knows when death may overtake me
Who lights our way in the darkest night
Who, Lord, shall to thy courts repair
Who made ocean, earth, and sky?
Who, O Lord, with Thee abiding
Who oâ€™er the waves from shore to shore
Who paid for my redemption
Who place on Sion's GOD their Trust
All the world lay still and silent in the morning grey
Who puts his trust in God most just
Who said, "come drink at the fountain"
Who seeks in weakness an excuse
Who shall abide in thy tabernacle?
Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord
When the trump of God shall sound And the nations gather round
In that awful hour when all the tribes of men
Who shall condemn to endless flames
Who shall dare to separate us
Who shall dwell, O Lord, with thee
Jesusâ€™ life is calling you
Who shall I send, the Savior is saying
Who shall roll the stone away?
Rough was the way, and dark, and cold
[Who Shall Separate Us?]
As we gather, Father, seal us
WHO the child of God shall sever
Go forth, the Lord's command today is sounding
Who can be sent into the field
Who trusts in God, a strong abode
Who was it, calling, while I was wandering
[Who was the first to strike a spark?]
Who was there to hear good news proclaimed
Who, who are these in bright array
Who will there be to sing
[Who Will Come and Follow Jesus]
To the lost ones far or near
In the day of salvation
Who will join the throng to heaven
Who will now indict me
Here I often sing for the friends I love
Who will suffer with the Savior,
Who will take the message to the fields so white
Who with God Most High finds shelter
Who would ever have believed it
Who would steal a life to satisfy a greed?
Who am I that the highest King
Who'd have thought the Lord Almighty
Whoever fears the Lord
Whoever lives beside the Lord
Whoever lives in these dark times
Whoever shelters with the LORD
Whoever true kindness would find should come here
Whoever would be saved
I've turned from the world and its follies,
[Wholehearted Thanks I Give You, Lord]
Wholehearted thanksgiving to you I will bring
Whoâ€™ll be sowing, whoâ€™ll be sowing
O whoâ€™ll stand up for Jesus
Whom Christ holds dear
Whom have I in heaven but thee? Whom on earth beside thee?
Whom have I in heaven but You, my God?
A friend have I who standeth near, To comfort me and still each fear
Theres one divine, unfailing Friend
Whom man forsakes thou wilt not leave
Art thou seeking the Savior of sinners
You hear me when I call
Whom shall I send? our Maker cries
Whom should I fear, since God to me
Whom should I fear, since God to me Is saving health and light? (Tate and Brady)
"Whoo-ee! Whoo-ee!" sings the wind
Who's been born without two parents?
Who's my neighbor? Who's my neighbor? Who's my neighbor?
Whoso believes and is baptized
Whoso would see this song of heavenly choice
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
Whosoever will may take His grace so free
O hear the joyful message
Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me
Wondrous love of Jesus, spread the news around
Whosoever is ringing o'er land and sea
Who may come to the Lord
Child of sin, why will ye wander

Whosoever will, blessed gospel call
[Why Am I Living? ]
Why are nations raging
Why are not sinners, Lord, consumed
The thirsty deer longs for the streams
Why are you standing, looking up
Worn and distrest, longing for rest!
Why art thou heavy hearted
Why art thou lost and why wilt thou stray
Why art thou thus cast down, my heart?
Why boast'st thou, tyrant, thy high crimes aloud?
Why, cruel Herod, dost thou fear
Why cruel Herod dost thou fear That God thy King is drawing near?
Why delay to make your peace with heav'n's eternal King?
I look upon the rugged cross
O hear the song the heavens are singing
Why do heathen nations rage? Why do peoples plot in vain?
Why do nations rage together
Why do the heathen furious rage
Why do the Heathen madly rage
Why do the nations move and rage
Why do the nations rage
Why do the people rage
O why do ye wait? 
Why do you stand so far away, O LORD?
Why do you wait, dear brother
With angels kneeling round His throne
Why does my God forsake me? will no more
Why does this phrase have five measures?
If you are weary and ladened with care
Why dost thou so lowly lie
Why flow these torrents of distress 
Why halt thus, O deluded heart
Why has God forsaken me?
Why hast for ever cast us off
Why hast thou cast us off, O God
Why, Herod, why the Godhead fear
You ask me why I love him, the Christ of Galilee
"Why is this night different from all of the others?"
Why keep Jesus waiting, waiting in the cold?
Why live here in sorrow that makes all life blue
Why longer wai?, the Lord is at thy side
If you want to be a Christian in this world below
Why are you straying away from the Lord
If you're living in the valley and your heart has lost its song
Why not now, my God, my God?
The Prince of glory left his throne, The sinner's friend to be
Why, O God, have you cast us off forever
Why, O my soul, why weepest thou
Why rage the heathen furiously
Why search the future and the past
Why should cross and trial grieve me?
Love sent my Savior to die in my stead
Behold the feathered fowls of air
Why should I ask the future load
Why should I be affrighted
[Why Should I Be Anxious?]
When my Savior, my Shepherd is near
Why should I deprive my neighbour
Sometimes He leads thru pastures green
Why should I fear the darkest hour
Why should I join with those in play
Why should I love my sports so well
Why should I not love Him
Why should I say, "'Tis yet too soon
Why should our garments, made to hide
Why should our mourning thoughts delight
Why should the haughty hero boast
Why should we weep when we behold
[Why So Downcast?]
Why stand so far away, my God?
Why standest thou afar, O Lord
Why stand'st thou Lord far off? why hid'st
Why stare at heavens' distant blue
Some may wonder why they cannot shout
Why this dark conspiracy
Why thus, my soul, cast down?
Why thus with grief oppressed, my heart
Turn ye, turn ye, turn ye, turn ye
Why without, then, art Thou staying
Why worry when you can pray?
Why would we light a lamp
Why yet refuse the path to choose
Wide as the world is your command
Wide oâ€™er earthâ€™s remotest border
Wide open are Thy hands
Wide open stand the gates adorned with pearl
Wide, ye heavenly gates, unfold
Wie teuer, Gott, ist deine Guete
[Wild and Lone the Prophet's Voice]
[Wild Creatures Long to Cool Their Tongues]
[Wild the Man and Wild the Place]
Wilds horrid and dark with o'er shadowing trees
Will e'er that sabbath-morning rise
Will God for ever cast us off?
When I reach the end of the journey here
I am building, daily building as I live from day to day
While trudging down the valley
As I tread this rugged way, I am thinking of the day
Someone must go with a smiling face
Once again we plead, O sinner
Will Jesus keep me, along life's journey
I think of that city on a far-away strand
When my work is done and my race is run
When I come to cross the stream to that land of which I dream
When we come to the river that flows dark and chill
In that land of peace and gladness
O beautiful Zion, the home of the blest
There's a valley dark and drear
When my pilgrimage on earth is over
O how sad to part with loved ones
Jesus is waiting to pardon your sin
When your life on earth is over
Are you ready for the Savior, should He come today?
Will you be ready when Jesus comes?
When the people of the earth are gathered and the wicked from the just are severed
Will you be ready to welcome your Savior
Some happy day in glory a throng will sing the story
There is a land that is free from tears
When He gives His grace and glory, to the ransomed Church of God
There's a happy land of promise just beyond the starry sky
We know there's a bright and a glorious home
List, the Spirit calls for thee
In the Father's house, where all is love
Will you come to Jesus?
Will you turn away from sin
Will you come, will you come, No longer to roam
Thro' the Saviour, crucified
Will you come and walk with me
Will you come and follow me if I but call your name?
O burdened soul no longer wait
Will you rise and follow Jesus
Will you fulfill the vow
In the distant lands of darkness
Will you meet me in the happy land
When we shall hear the final call, from the blessed Savior of all
There's a land that is fairer than day
There's a land that is fairer than day
There will come a time when here I will be leaving
Will you meet me by the river on the brighter, better strand
I am bound for that city eternal
Where the right and the true live forever anew
Will you meet me up in glory
There's a City of love, in the heavens above
I've a beautiful home in a wonderful land
Will you not be a reaper, to gather golden grain
When life's work is ended, and I shall cross o'er
You have heard the good old gospel
Willie laid him down to sleep
Lord art Thou willing to forgive?
Have you yet sought a soul to win
Wilt thou forgive that sin, where I begun
Win another Friend or brother
Win boys and girls for Christ today
Out in the darkness of sin there are souls
He that winneth souls is wise, Strive one soul to win
Win the world for Christ, shall be our cry
Wind who makes all winds that blow
Jesus told us all about You
'Wine is a mocker;' so the word
Since I found the heavenly road true joy has been mine
When the race still lies before me
Winning men for Jesus everywhere we go
Winning souls for Jesus
Winning the battle in the name of Jesus our King
We are marching along in the gospel light
â€œThe sky is dreary and rainy
Winter in his heart of gloom
[Wise Men of Old Came Seeking]
Wise men, they came to look for wisdom
Wise ones on a journey far
How long, forgetful of thy heavenly birth
With a glad new song I am pressing on
Bravely take your stand at the Lord's command
With a heart full of anxious request
[With a Joyful Heart]
With a joyful song we will march along
In common prayer our hearts ascend
When we are lost, and cannot find the way
With all my heart I want to love You, Lord
With all my heart I thank You, Lord
With all my heart I'll sing praise to You my King
With all my heart, eternal God
With all my heart I cry, O LORD, please answer!
With all my heart I thank you, LORD
With all my heart my thanks I bring
With all my heart will I record
With all our heart and with all our mind
With all the powers my poor heart hath
With all the saints, with prophets and martyrs
With all thy power, O Lord, defend
With all thy soul love God above
[With All Who in this Hallowed Place]
With ardent voice unto the Lord I cry
With awe approach the mysteries
With beauty decked the morn ascends
With bitter herbs, with wine and bread
With broken heart and contrite sigh
With constant endeavor for Christ and the Church
With constant faith surpassing doubt
[With Empty Hands and Empty Hearts]
With eternity's values in view, Lord
With ever restless, and ungoverned rage
Long has been my search for truth and right
With faith I pray, O Lord Divine
With faith in God you can climb the highest hill
It was on one Christmas day, when our father went away
With fiery serpents greatly pained
With firm resolve I held my peace
With gifts that differ by your grace
With glad, exuberant carolings
With gladness we hail the blessed day
With gladsome hearts we come
With glorious clouds encompassed round
With glory clad, with strength arrayed
With God all things are possible
With God and His mercy, His Spirit and Word
I thank you, Lord, for each new day
With grateful heart my thanks I bring
With grateful hearts our faith professing
Use us as instruments, simple vessels of your peace
With guilt that is deep in its stain
From heaven Christ my Savior came
With happy song we make our way along
Father, with happy voices
With harp, and with trumpet, and with all that is glorious
With harps and with viols
With heart and soul, with mind and might
With heart and voice in one accord
With heart sincere, thy praise, O Lord, I'll sing
With hearts in tune, with one accord
With heavy hearts they set their sights toward home
With high delight let us unite
With holy zeal and Christian grace
With humble grace they served their Lord
[With Humble Justice Clad and Crowned]
With inward pain my heart-strings sound
With Jesus for hero, for teacher and friend
When storm winds are sweeping, and dark shadows fall
With joy and by the Spirit led
With joy and gladness in my soul
With joy draw water from the spring
With joy I heard my friends exclaim
With joy I heard the people say
With joy let us sing to the LORD, all you righteous
With joy you will draw water
With lawless lips, unbridled tongue
O God of all creation
With me, ye varied nations, hymn your God
With measureless form and virtue came
With men impossible
With Miriam we will dance
A picture I see so precious to me
With mournful voice, and ardent cries
With my heart I worship You
Savior, time is fleeting by
With my whole heart I will praise God
With my whole heart, my God and King, Thy praise I will proclaim (Tate and Brady)
With my whole Heart, my GOD and King, Thy worthy praise I will proclaim (Hopkinson)
With my whole heart, my sacrifice
"With one accord" within an upper room
Take the Word and go out to ev'ry land
[With One Voice They Joined Their Praise]
Out of the depths I cry to you
With praise, O God, we worship Thee
With praises and thanksgiving
With raised voice, to God, our strength
O mighty God, when I behold the wonder
With reverence and with godly fear
[With Sighs too Deep for Words]
With solemn faith we offer up
With solemn shout we sing thy praise
With song and music we go on
With tender joy we praise thee, Lord
With thankful hearts we sing
With thankful hymns address the mighty Lord
With the body that was broken
With the Lord begin your task
With the Lord there is mercy
With the merciful Thou wilt show Thyself merciful
With the morn in radiance breaking
With the shepherds, adoration
With the sweet word of peace
With thee, great God, the stores of light
[With Their Foolish Fig Leaves Flapping]
With them that strive, and fight with me
Joining together on this journey with you
With this New Year we raise new songs
Lord, possess me now, I pray
[With Trembling Awe the Chosen Three]
[With Trembling Bliss of Eager Hearts]
With undivided heart and ceaseless songs
With unmoved patience, for the Lord
With voices sounding, clear notes resounding
With wandering Jacob, let us say
With welcome heart we greet you, Lord
With what delight, great God, I trace
With what fervor of devotion
Though falsely men revile or hate me
When Iâ€™m feeling all alone
[With You, O Lord]
With you, O Lord, is life in all its fullness
With thy presence, Lord, our head and Savior
Withering as grass is humankind
Within a crib my Savior lay
[Within a Womb of Darkness]
In our darkness, kindle a fire
O ancient love, processing through the ages
[Within the Busy Rush of Life]
Within the day to day
Within the Father's house
Within the garden's sombre shade
[Within The Love of God I Hide]
Within the Meditation Hall
Come now, the feast is spread
Within the shadow of the cross
Within the shelter of our walls,
Within the veil
Within the world around us
Within your house, O God, today
Within Your shelter, loving God
Within your temple, Lord
Without a doubt He is my Savior
We return to you deep within
O God, you are without
To be love where hatred is common
Witnessing for Jesus I'm telling of His love

Woe to the man, eternal woe

Wonderful Friend to me
After the end of strife and of this earthly life
Wonderful grace

Wonderful, infinite peace
Wonderful is the love of Christ our Savior
What a wonderful Savior is Jesus
Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me
Just to be along with my Redeemer, telling Him all about my woes
Since the dear Saviour came and saved me from the old life of sin and shame
When I am tried in Christ I confide
I am going to the land of song
Jesus has shown me a wonderful light
I'm telling of Jesus so loving and true
O Lord, my soul rejoiceth in Thee
It was wonderful love Jesus showed on the cross
Wonderful love is flooding my soul as I go on my way
Jesus my Lord came down to earth to die
Wonderful love of Jesus, Wonderful love to me
When I was lost in sin, Jesus the Lord came in
Wonderful, merciful Savior
Wonderful fountain that cleanseth from sin
Here in Godâ€™s Word is a message
Wonderful morning, wonderful morning

Coming to Jesus, my Savior, I found
Like radiant sunshine that comes after rain
Wonderful power of my wonderful King
Wonderful redemption full and free
Wonderful, wonderful Savior!
Greatest of treasures, God's gift supreme
Wonderful it is that Jesus came
A wonderful story of heavenly glory
Friend, have you heard the sweet story
What wonderful joy I'm having today
Down from the heavens came Jesus the King
Wonderful tho't that comes to me, when I shall cross the mystic sea
Wonderful thy name we call
I travel on the radiant sunpath of love
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus
Jesus fills all my life with peace
Sing them over again to me

Wondrous are your ways, O God
We behold your heavens, O Lord
Wondrous King, all-glorious
The meadows there are always green
There is no love like the love of Jesus
Wondrous voice, which cries with power
Swifter than bird in the flight
I am ever pressing onward
After we cross the silent river and are safe at home forever
When sorrows are ended and troubles are o'er
On that bright eternal morning, when the Saviour is returning
Some sweet day our Lord will come again
Here we have sorrow, Pain, grief and care
There's a message of love from the Father above
Tho' so many disappointments here I often meet
Hear the voice of Jesus speaking to the soul
Wood of the cradle, wood of the cross
O God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
Word by God the Father sent
Word of God, come down on earth
Word of God, eternal Son
Word of God, from Mary's womb
Word of God in human language
Word of God, speak
I'm finding myself at a loss for words
Word of God, you spoke creation
[Word of Justice]
Word of life, most pure, most strong
Word of the Father, source of all things living
Wiping away the tears
Words of eternal life to me
We must work and pray together
Go work today, no longer delay
Hasten away to the harvest field
Work, for the night is coming
Be ye not weary in serving your King
There is work to do for Jesus, Yes, a glorious work to do
Sigh not to labor in fields that are wide
Work while it is to-day
There are lonely hearts to cherish
There is work for all to do in the harvest field today
O how sweet to live in a Savior's love
O what joy it is for me
Shall I be content with one star
Working, working for the blessed Master
I am working for the Master
EARNESTLY seeking to save and to heal
Working on in the field of duty
There's work to do, but isn't it fun
World, farewell! Of thee I'm tired
With thankful voice praise ye the Lord
Praise to the Lord for the joys of the earth
Place my feet on the land
Worldly cares a moment leave us
Rise, O church, and lift your voices
Worship God for saints before us
You are beautifully different
Worship Him. Worship Him.
Father God, Jehovah is Your Name
Sing to the Savior a song of praise
Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness
Worthy art Thou, O Lord, our God
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain

My heart overflows with praise to the Lord
Worthy of worship, worthy of praise
Hear the cries of the shackled
[Worthy the Lamb That Was Slain]
Worthy, You are worthy
Would I have answered when you called
Would that I were more closely bound
If in the clouds Jesus came for His own
If Jesus were standing before you tonight
Would you build a home in which God could reside?
Would you know the sweetest peace
Would you win men's souls to God
Wouldst thou inherit life with Christ on high?
Wounded for me, wounded for me
Wounded world that cries for healing
Yield to me now, for I am weak
Write these words in our hearts
Write thy word upon our hearts, O Lord
In the book of life in heaven now my name is written down

You gods and rulers, can you claim
Be holy, be lowly

You'd better min' how you talk
You'll always be happy

You've called us together, O God, by your grace
You've carried your burden, you've carried it long
For a long time here I wandered
O brother take heed where you are going
Zacchaeus was a wee little man
Zaccheus climbed the tree
Zeal is that pure and heavenly flame
O that now mine eyes were fountains

Zion mourns in fear and anguish
Zion, on the holy hills
Zion, praise thy Savior, singing
Zion rejoice, lift up your voice
